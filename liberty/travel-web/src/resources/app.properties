//Text for Restaurant1's Personality (Yelp reviews of BBI Berlinburger International)
RESTAURANT1_TEXT=We went to BBI on a sunday for lunch. The place is quite small (3 tables and benches on the street, not really clean) so it was almost full. There is a lot of choice, the burgers are very original and you can add extra topping of... everything I could imagine. The portion are really big, the burgers are delicious. We shared a &#34;fries and chili&#34; for two and it was still too much. In the burgers, there is a lot of meat and cheese (and very good ones), but also a lot of salad. The bread was fresh, and the sauces very tasty. The fries and chili are generous (better share it for 3 people). There is again a lot of meat in the chili, and ketchup + mayo on the tables.We weren&#39;t really picky on the hygiene of the tables because the prices are more than correct, and again the burgers delicious. As an advice : if you can, better order as take-away and eat at ease in home. So good. So messy. So busy.I really dug this place, be warned that there is virtually no seating on busy days.Actually, hold up, I am going to add that fifth star, this place had Nintendo to play while I waited. I was going to write a lengthy introduction about my approach to burgers, but the point of this review is pretty straightforward: go eat at Berlinburger International. Like, go *now*.I&#39;ve eaten the best burger in my life in this place and believe me, I&#39;ve eaten some pretty sweet burgers. Went for the rather classic BBQ-Burger and it was pure perfection. The bun was crispy, but not too crispy; beef was done, but not too dry; biting through bacon didn&#39;t remind me of chewing gum, like burgers often do; vegetables had a fresh taste to them. Above all, the sauce was just outworldly tasty and poured in perfect balance to the rest of the ingredients, which means it didn&#39;t leak through the bun, didn&#39;t turn it wet. This burger deserved a poem.Additionally I ordered their chilli-cheese fries, which were also very tasty and a welcome change to the usually boring fries offered in most burger places.The only downside was... the queue, we&#39;ve had to wait for about 15-20 minutes to order and another 20-ish for the burgers themselves. On the other hand, that in itself should be a good recommendation.Visiting Berlin? Put BBI in your itinerary. Just amazing burgers. I think the best one in Berlin! It&#39;s a small place not far from Gorlitzer Park, very hipster and not expensive. Very popular place, that&#39;s why sometimes you should wait 10-15 min for the place outside, but a better way to order it &#34;take away&#34;.Recommend to everyone! Those guys really put some effort into making great burgers and fries. Their menu is short, but each intems on it is a mouth watering treat.And while you, they have a 1980s video console. Outstanding burgers but expect to wait in line! We did the mistake of visit during a Saturday night and queued for 2 hours, 1 hour to order and 1 to get our takeaway (minimum seating). But it was worth it. The flavors were amazing, the meat-bun-topping ratio was perfect and the sweet potato fries (yes they have them!) were crispy.  Overall, a very positive experience but I would like and hope that they fix that queuing system, it was awful!  Also, be aware that it is in a very hipster-y neighborhood, not really our scene but the burgers were great. Really nice juicy burgers. Great french fries. The place is really small though so not much tables and the place is usually packed so it takes some time until you order and get your food but nice place overall. Not vegan friendly Stopped by on the recommendation of my burger-obsessed flatmate. Their (monthly) special, the Godzillarin came with a kimchi slaw, chili mayo, wasabi peas, and fried wonton skins (like chips). The second I bit into the burger, I exclaimed &#34;this makes so much sense!&#34; The wasabi peas added a nose-stinging punch (in a good way), the crispy wonton skins added nice texture, and the pickled kimchi slaw was a perfect contrast to the meat. I&#39;ve never had a burger with this combination, it worked well, so 5 stars!Note: the beef patty was a bit well-done, my only complaint to an otherwise inventive and tasty burger. I think the hype bug has hit this place or maybe it hit me before I arrived. The burger I ate was perfectly *normal*. I would choose Tommi&#39;s or Burgermeister over this any day. The interior is cool, but you probably won&#39;t be spending any time in there because it&#39;s so small and popular. Obviously it&#39;s a matter of opinion, but I&#39;m not that into this place...Logistically that visit was fine. We didn&#39;t have to wait in line for too long, and we got a seat at one of the very few tables outside. But the burger was just not what I was expecting and definitely didnt fulfill my craving. First of all it was impossible to eat with my hands. The burger bun was way too crispy so when I would try to take a bite the top bun would fall apart and I couldn&#39;t get a grip on the rest of the burger to get all the ingredients together for a real bite. The top bun was also significantly smaller than the bottom piece. That was just.... annoyingThe meat was cooked all the way through which is generally a bad sign for a real burger place.I also just prefer a sturdy piece of lettuce on my burger (romaine, butter lettuce, iceberg lettuce)... so it&#39;s easy to incorporate it into a bite. There were just way to many kinds of small pieces of lettuce on my burger (cabbage, rucola, spinach, etc), which I wasn&#39;t into at all. But, in all fairness, it does state clearly on the menu that there are &#34;assorted kinds of lettuce&#34; on the burger so it&#39;s pretty much my fault for not having requested my burger without it.In general everything tasted good but it&#39;s just not  my kind of burger (and I&#39;m from the US so I know my burgers!!) I didn&#39;t get fries so I cant judge those at all. They looked yummy though. Well, after all the talks and rumors around this burger I just had to go and find out myself what&#39;s the fuss about this place- the place is really small yet super cool, nice staff and the food is prepared slowly but with lots of attention to every patty.The special are really interesting, and the wedges are really tastyI can&#39;t say it&#39;s one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had but it&#39;s one of the most special I&#39;ve tried for sure, worth the visit. I will come again ;) Actually the burger wasn&#39;t as good as it looks. Primarily the reason is the low quality bun, which sort of just fell apart, being very light and without much substance.In a way that was true for the whole burger.Also, one should know that the place is tiny. Really liked this small restaurant with the super nintendo while waiting for the burger! I had the cheeseburger and was really juicy and nice flavours! The manager is a really friendly guy that always has a smile Best. Burger. Ever.It&#39;s a hole in the wall and they aren&#39;t famous for their service. But when you get to eat the best burger of your life at the other end of the world, well... Nothing else matters. Seriously the best burger I&#39;ve had in berlin. Maybe anywhere. I had the barbecue burger (no jalapeños) and sweet potato fries. The fries were crispy and crunchy perfection, and the burger was a massive hunk of deliciously rare meat. The inside seating area was packed, so we grabbed a table outside despite the freezing cold. We had burgers to keep our hands warm. Definitely going back. Honestly, as some people have said, the meat was just wayyyyy too salty. It was also way too packed and overhandled. The secret to a good burger is barely touching the meat. The cheese was also not melted.... However, the wedges were great and the wasabi mayo was delicious! It is too bad the burger was just not that great. Yeah, it&#39;s pretty good but there are a lot of really good burger places in the area. Better than most though. My favorite burgers in Berlin so far - large, in charge, and delicious.  The actual patty and bun size aren&#39;t overwhelmingly huge (thank goodness, I think some Berlin burger joints over do it for the sake of notoriety) but loaded with toppings.I thoroughly enjoyed my cheeseburger w/ jalapenos and my husband also enjoyed his Mexican-style burger, which was one of the specials that day.  My burger came with a big ol&#39; pile of jalapenos under the bun so I was a very happy American!And my husband&#39;s burger had an insane amount of guac &amp; other toppings for only about 1.50 euro more than the standard burgers.  The burgers have way too much salad to fit in any normal human&#39;s mouth - I just pushed some of mine off and ate it as a mini side salad. :)The potato wedges are also amazing!  Although you should only order them if you are really, really hungry, like we were.The location is a little odd and could be hard to find if you aren&#39;t looking carefully.  The inside is very small and there isn&#39;t much seating indoors or out so try to go when it might be less crowded!  We went on a cold Thursday holiday and got lucky with the wait time and seating but by the time we left there was a line out the door.The prices are lower than some other more &#34;upscale&#34; (i.e. good quality beef and unique burgers) burger places in the area.  I am looking forward to my next visit! BBI is an institution. Awesome burgers at a good price. The only thing I can fault is a lack of seating. It&#39;s almost all outside, which is not great in cooler weather, and almost always full. This only speaks for the popularity of the place though. I ordered the haloumi burger, being a vegetarian. It was the tastiest burger without meat I&#39;ve ever tasted. Sufficient condiments in the burger and a generous amount of haloumi. Very reasonable pricing.  I was super impressed and will definitely go back. The best burger I have eaten!!! Cheap, nice service, great music and you can play Nintendo while you&#39;re waiting for your meal. Not so many seats though. No need to doubt - just go!! Found myself in Neukolln today, so I decided to finally head over to BBI. I ordered a cheeseburger which in itself was just okay. The meat was a bit over salted, but the freshness of the other accoutrements (lettuce/tomato/onion) kind of made up for this. Kind of. But what really made up for the saltiness of the meat was that the potato wedges were super delicious and well-seasoned. I mean, they were really, really good. Order them. Now. They were so good, I&#39;d trek all the way back to BBI just for the potato wedges. On top of the awesome wedges, the guys working behind the counter called me &#34;Joy Division&#34; when my order was ready and then said with every pun intended, &#34;We hope you enJOY your food.&#34; and then started giggling, which was quite adorkable and made me smile. If only for the service and wedges alone, I&#39;m a fan. This is the best burger joint in Berlin. No doubt about it. Great fries and potato wedges. The only problem with the place is that it is a little out of the way and there is very limited seating. On days when the weather is good you can eat outside but otherwise there are only about 10 stools in this joint. Looks super big and tastes ok but I don&#39;t like that super small room. Sitting and waiting outside is ok..always crowded Not sure how long the restaurant has been around, but BBI is clearly a small operation in about the tightest space you could find in Berlin. The kitchen is the counter, so temperatures get up to around 100 degrees Farhenheit or so. For that reason, I think the staff is really harried and might need to hire more staff and take more breaks so that they aren&#39;t so crabby to their customers. That being said, BBI&#39;s burger is delicious. I or the haloumi and chili cheese fries. The haloumi burger had the most delightful light tartar/yogurt sauce. I&#39;m not quite sure what was in it, but I kept wanting to bite more hunks of perfectly fried cheese. The burger bun was soft and dense. It perfectly capture the contents of the burger. The chilli cheese fries were also good, but probably a good idea to share with friends. I had to do it balanced out the veggie option. Fries could have been crispier, but there was plenty of meat, cheese, and a lot of jalapeño to go around. The wait for take-away was 30 minutes. Thankfully, they have an old version of Mario that you can play on a classic Nintendo. Make sure to check in because the loudspeaker outside doesn&#39;t work. Bonne appetit! burger was larger than my head Serious burger business. One of the few burger places, that gets it right. Right burger size, right amount of toppings and even rightly toasted buns. Like Melanie K precisely said above: the correct way of eating a burger here is open your jaw, press your face into one of these delights and start pushing it in with your hands. This place has some awesome burger! One of the best burger restaurants in Berlin. Best to visit in summer so you can sit outside because the place itself is pretty small. HUGE burger, pretty good. I love my burgers and the ones from Berlin Burger is up there with the best I&#39;ve ever had anywhere in the world. Prices are ok and they have beer (it&#39;s Berlin after all) but expect to have to wait for a table or just go find a seat nearby. Also they had Super Mario Brothers 3 on an old NES to keep you entertained while you wait. This is just the best burger EVER in Europe! I was amazed by the quality of the pattie, the freshness of the veggies and the incredibly tasty BBQ sauce.  The selection of organic drinks is nice but could be much better.  The out door seating is a must , that is if you can find a spot. Usually is mega packed !It is not cheap for Berlin standard but still not crazily expensive . Just perfect !They understood exactly what had to be done in this jungle that is the Burger business :)Just a very small and simple place, no tables inside, just order. Burgers are huge, awesome, and cheap as the rest of the food in Berlin.Best burger so far in Berlin! Simply the BEST burger place in town! And I think we have tried them almost all! Fresh meat, a bucket of salad and amazing wedges! It cant get any better! Those boys are geniuses! One of the best burgers in Berlin. It is just a really small place. So just notice that it is not a big restaurant to sit in. Lamb in a burger?  Come on.  This place has got a great reputation, but I never went back after a single visit.  I guess you could call me a burger purist, but I do not find adding lamb to a burger mixture an improvement.  Either BBI is onto something that the rest of the world simply hasn&#39;t figured out, or Berliners just can&#39;t seem to decipher what a proper burger tastes like.  My money is on the latter. Chilli cheese fries were reallllllly tasty but they were not very hot temperature wise... Considering how busy the place was I thought they&#39;d have hot fries on the go. The burger didn&#39;t rock my world but I was happy to be eating one all the same. Order the chill cheese fries. I ordered a BBQ Burger....the cool thing about these burgers, they take the word &#34;international&#34; seriously. So inside the burger there was Feta-cheese and rocket salad.The meat is great, the salads are fresh, and the sauces are yummy.The bread and the potato wedges could have been a bit better. I found this place randomly as I was renting a room nearby, and as I love burgers and it looked popular I had to give it a try.Nondescript bun, gas-grilled (for that burnt fat odour and taste that some people think resembles charcoal smoke) patty, reasonably fresh but not really tasty lettuce. Why the local hipsters flock to the place is beyond me, but the overcrowding and resulting wait doesn&#39;t exactly add to the experience.The third star is for were the near-perfect fries which had clearly been fried in still fresh sunflower seed oil. Great Burger place in Berlin at a place where you want find tourists. Close to no space inside but there are tables outside as well. Friendly staff and great taste. I&#39;ll go back :) After a love fest with BBI, our love has waned. Limited seating, ridiculously long waits, and hispters galore we were ready to wade through. But last night was really too much. We arrived around 19 to the usually line and waited to get to the front. Stacks of buns with toppings were waiting for the burger to be grilled. Not appetizing seeing the lettuce wilt and buns become soft. Informed it would be a 40 min wait (for 2 burgers!) we inwardly groaned &amp; said fine. ordering the special, we were informed there was no guacamole, but there was avocado. Wait - what? Just mash those up idle workers! Reluctantly, we said ok. I then ordered a chicken burger. No chicken. Ok - hamburger. Potato wedges. Also out. Are you kidding? We ordered three things and they couldn&#39;t satisfy one request. We finally said no thanks and walked away. This user has arrived from Qype, a company acquired by Yelp in 2012.

//Text for Restaurant2's Personality (Yelp reviews of Dolores)
RESTAURANT2_TEXT=Best burritos in town.black beans, beef, peanut, hot onions and its done, well donetry it, u won&#39;t regret This place was recommended to me by several friends. I&#39;m not a big fan of burrito, but I decided to give it one more shot, in one of the best (apparently) shops in Berlin.The biggest downside is that the place gets very crowded at lunchtime (I passed it a couple of times before), so you need to factor that in. Staff could be more helpful, but with that many customers it&#39;s understandable that they want to focus on serving you quick. Prices are average for Berlin (€6-7 for regular sized fast food meal).The food was fresh, and okay, but still haven&#39;t changed my opinion about burrito. We were hoping for a little piece of home here. We got it, but mostly from the giant floor-to-ceiling map of the Mission District in SF posted on the walls of the dining area. The burritos here weren&#39;t too bad, but if you rep&#39; the name you gotta&#39; have da game! My wife and I both optioned for the Naughty Pork. We weren&#39;t feeling especially nice that day, but we normally are! Honestly, most of the ingredients were really good and I really liked the options here (you pretty much have at least two options for every major burrito component). The carnitas fell short in the burritos, however, as they were just too dry and a little bit lacking in the flavor department.Still, one of the better burritos we&#39;ve had since moving to Germany and it will definitely be a spot that we return to on any subsequent Berlin visits, but we will likely forgo the carnitas nächstes Mal. I had really high hopes for Dolores. Alas, the quest for a great burrito in Germany continues. Mr. hubby and I both ordered the carnitas burrito. The tortilla was warmed like it was steamed, yay! The fillings were not so bad. I think it was the meat that wasn&#39;t quite right. It was a bit on the dry side. It is still the best burrito I&#39;ve had in Germany. Next time, I think I would build my own burrito.The decorations were all of SF, which is of course something you&#39;ll only see outside of SF. I guess I appreciated the SF love oozing from every wall of the shop. My expectations were high as was my desire for Mexican food. I ordered the vegan friend and it was served quickly. The tortilla is a nice texture and it was folded well. However, the inside was one mushy texture and quite sweet. The spices used resembled curry and not at all what I&#39;d expect in a burrito. However the habanero salsa was truly spicy but not overpowering. I had a few bites of the pork burrito which contained tasty pulled pork but was also quite sweet. We got a side of chips were slightly overcooked and greasy. The fresh salsa served with them was sweet and bland, fresh is certainly not a word I&#39;d use to describe it. We also got the guacamole which had a great texture and seemed fresh but it was quite bland. It explains why so many people were returning their trays with 1/2 eaten plates of food.The food is not terrible but it&#39;s not good enough that I would go back. On the upside service was friendly and they offer some unusual beers. Dolores seems like a popular burrito spot based on the 10+ minute wait time.  However, I wasn&#39;t super impressed.I got the &#34;Naughty Pork,&#34; and although I appreciated the name, the pork itself was so dry (not in the good, crunchy way) that it practically hurt to swallow, and its strong orange juice flavor took over the whole burrito.  The flour tortilla was nice and soft, and I liked the zesty green rice, but the beans were too thick and goopy for my taste.  Maybe I&#39;m just too partial to a more juicy burrito, but I was really wishing for more salsa (maybe the Habanero?) or sour cream to rescue the texture and the flavor.I&#39;m still grateful to Dolores because at only 6.50, my burrito made a filling dinner and rescued me from eating German food one too many times.  The ordering process was also very streamlined and easy.  Still, in the end, even these good qualities and my undying love for burritos couldn&#39;t redeem the unbalanced food here :( I really love Dolores for their easy and simple Burritos. Ordering here is super easy since it&#39;s explained step by step.Food comes usually really quick and the only problem you might have is getting a seat. Since this place is well known and loved you have to make a make compromises such as joining a table where other people are already sitting but hey why not? It&#39;s a good opportunity to meet new people!I love their burritos, my favourite is a mix of: chipotle, Mexican super rice, fajita veggies, cheese and smoky corn soy. BOOM! Their ice teas are also extremely good and not overly sugared! I usually visit this place when I&#39;m close by and not in the mood for Asian food. Really good food, not too crazy expensive (for Berlin standards). However, constantly 110% HIPSTER-CONTAMINATED =-OSo just grab your food to go, and you&#39;re fine ;)My Burrito-recommendation: Wicked Beef! I always think its a bit unfair for west coast Americans to write reviews of foreign Mexican restaurants, but here I am. Continuing my quest for decent European Mexican, I land in Berlin to try Dolores, which I had heard good things about. First things first, this place was packed. I hate crowds, so this place was a bit stressful for me. There are so many people waiting in line and standing around to poach a table that its not really the most relaxing experience. Perhaps avoid lunch time?Anyway, after ordering and staring at people for 10 minutes waiting for a table, we finally got to it. First things first, the tortilla chips should be commended. Making your own fresh chips gets you a big thumbs up. Thumbs down for the tiny side of guacamole. Enough for 5 chips, then youre sad. Next, thumbs up for fresh, steamed burrito tortillas. Finally, a place that has figured out that steaming the tortilla before you fill  it is key. The rest was a bit rough. I ordered the chicken burrito and the chicken was marinated in something strange. I couldnt put my finger on it, but it was not super enjoyable. Man had the pork burrito and wasnt blown away. The good news is that it is totally decent and will put to bed your Mexican craving. The burrito portions are also huge, so you arent going to go hungry. Well someone might be a little observed with San Francisco. It&#39;s borderline creepy when you walk into Dolores. Having lived in SF, I was a little startled; sure the restaurant is named after an area in SF but I was not expecting this. The restaurant is lined with a map of SF over several walls. The ambiance of the place can only be described as totally hipster serving only to bolster the SF like experience. Add a long queue to the place and they&#39;ll have it completely downI&#39;ve been in Germany just over 5 months now and the struggle to find a burrito as those I had whilst in SF has been well a struggle. I got a naughty pork burrito. Sadly yet again  this does come short of the burrito I grew accustomed to. However definitely one of the best I&#39;ve had thus far in Germany; for one they got the tortilla right but it just didn&#39;t feel complete. It may also be catering for the german palette too I suppose. What really stood out though was the pork in that burrito. I haven&#39;t had anything like it! I think its pulled pork that is made in some delicious sauce. I honestly could eat that pork all on its own.They have a pretty wide menu and you can create your own burrito, very quick service and nice staff. The search continues for amazing Mexican food in Berlin. The food was okay, but it still hasn&#39;t hit the spot for my Mexican craving. Similar atmosphere/food type as Chipotle in the U.S. but nowhere near as tasty. The chips were really good though. When I originally found Dolores I laughed and mocked the idea of there being an SF Burrito place in Berlin.  Then after a long day of wandering the city my husband and I decided we needed to give Dolores a shot, after all we practically live in the Mission. Maybe it was because I&#39;d set my expectations low, but I was really quite pleased with my burrito.  I built my own with  shredded pork, cilantro rice, fajita veggies, guac, cheese and sour cream,  topped with their habanero sauce.  I wanted it spicy!  Is it like a burrito in the Mission, no, but it is really good.  I was mostly impressed with the quality and quantity of their pork.  I would have eaten the shredded pork by itself it&#39;s that good, and I dare say it&#39;s better than any shredded pork I&#39;ve had in SF.  It was a very generously sized burrito and I ended up not being able to finish the whole thing, and I hate leaving food behind.  My husband had one of their burrito bowls, it was a bit more like a giant taco salad, but still pretty delish.  The only thing we didn&#39;t really care about were the chips.  The chips were a bit greasy but they make them themselves so points for trying.Not cheap but not super pricey given the amount of food you get.They have plenty of seating inside and a bunch of picnic tables outside.  Food comes up pretty fast, and the place was hoppin&#39;.  If you&#39;re in Berlin you should obviously try to eat something more local, but if you&#39;re there for a longer stay definitely give Dolores a try. The food is amazing! I recommend the sweet chipotle chicken or adobo beef. I also like the salsa cruda (which isn&#39;t actually that spicy) and salsa verde. Expect to wait a few minutes in line and have limited seating, but it was all definitely worth it. In Berlin for business. Found this place while wandering the streets. Great food. Nice people at the register. Some of the menu is in English and they were able to understand my broken German! I love Dolores, it&#39;s consistent and tasty and you can keep on trying new combinations every time. It is definitely the best California style burrito in Berlin and has yet to be beaten by any other Tex mex joint here.Only thing is I wish they&#39;d take cards - id probably come more often. Simply the best! Ja, es ist manchmal anstrengend hier, da etwas laut, die Schlange etwas lang und die Tische etwas knapp sind. Aber, und das ist wohl das wichtigste, es ist unheimlich lecker!! I am working around the corner and visit the place quite often. Really nice lunch place: quick, tasty at modest prices for such big portions.Delicious burritos and other stuff. Similar to Chipotle in US you can simply build your own ones or select pre-defined ones but the whole location has way more style.hints:* try to avoid 12.30-13.30 or accept 20 min waiting time.* if you go with the bowl, order the chips on the side.* dont forget to order extra guacamole!* drink selection is quite nice, try the Augsburger Bier! The burrito tasted authentic like in the states, however it wasn&#39;t too good. The meat and the beans were way too overpowering and made it kinda gross. The juice and the lime/mint lemonade were great. I loved the big map of San Fran on the wall. However after eating there I didn&#39;t feel good for the next couple of hours. I used to think this place was like, amazing. Now I think I had Stockholm Syndrome from staying in Berlin too long. It&#39;s a welcome alternative to the sea of German blandness, but it pales in comparison to many stateside spots. Can&#39;t complain though-- it&#39;s better than currywurst. The staff said Vegan Lover was the most popular choice so I gave it a try. The burrito is tasty and filling, but not very authentic Mexican, slightly disappointing. I just remember a lot of black bean and not enough guacamole. Not bad but I wouldn&#39;t go back. This place is pretty OK and is definitely tasty. That being said, in Berlin and perhaps all of Germany it is impossible to get proper burrito. I have searched all over this city and no luck. Dolores brings a valiant effort and I was full when I left but like other places it is just off from a real burrito. I found it to be a bit pricey (obviously because of the location in the main tourist zone at Alexanderplatz). Burritos are supposed to be cheap food.  Staff was very friendly and is really the reason why I gave it 4 stars not 3.  They were patient while I stumbled through ordering in German which was nice.  Most places in Mitte just flip to English and send you on your way.  I will continue to go here whenever I have a craving for some texmex style grub. Quiet authentic Mexican joint. Fast food atmosphere but they use a lot of greens and offer vegetarian and vegan options. Staff is a little over the top Ordered food was ready really fast. For me personally chicken burrito I have ordered was really big but it was so delicious. And also moto is  awesome, who needs 1000 friends when you can have 1 amigo! Brilliant.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll come back again The American occupation of Berlin continues despite the Berlin Wall coming down!Dolores is a burrito joint that seems to have been lifted straight out of California and plonked in the heart of Berlin, close to Alexanderplatz. The staff all sport American accents with the same chirpy demeanour we expectYou can customise your burrito to your heart&#39;s content if you want or you can choose one of their pre-made selections. I choose the lime chicken and complemented it with lemonadeAs burritos go, this was an enjoyable one with succulent chicken given more life with the guacamole and salsa I had in the burrito. The lemonade was nice and refreshing even if the weather outside was perishing (my first white Easter!)It can get busy with the limited seating filling up quickly but if you fancy a bit of CaliMex in Berlin, this is a good option Burrito tested and approved by an American! And you could tell this place has some creds when there is a long line (mostly of hipsters) to order. It took about 20 minutes from line to getting my food, and the wait was worth it.Dolores deviates from being an authentic Mexican burrito place given that they have a LOT of vegan-friendly options, but I applaud them for doing this. I&#39;m no vegan, but their &#34;green rice&#34; (basmati rice made green from fresh cilantro and lime juice) was better than most rice that I&#39;ve had in a burrito. I love that they have various types of sauces (i.e. tomato salsa, smoky peanut salsa, chipotle mayo, etc) and meats (and not just 1 but 2 types of vegan soy meats!) for you to try with your burrito. I had an adobo beef burrito with the aforementioned green rice, black beans, cheese, and extra guacamole. It was a HUGE burrito that I could have split into 2 meals, and it only costed 7 EUR. And with a homemade ginger lemonade to go with my meals, I was one happy girl!Those searching for an authentic burrito might be disappointed, but if you just want to get a burrito with interesting flavors, then Dolores won&#39;t disappoint. i had a &#34;vegan lover&#34; with cheese extra and without rice. Burrito Baby was a little bit more the way i like it, but they&#39;re both nearly on a par. Dolores is slightly cheaper but burritos seem to be a little bit smaller. They&#39;re customers tend to be a little bit touristy, which isn&#39;t to blame on the owners. Staff is nice. Atmosphere is quite like it is in a fast food restaurant. While nowhere near as good as Maria Bonita, Dolores is still a solid option for some quality eats. I hesitate to use the word &#34;Tex-Mex&#34;, because almost all Mexican food outside the states falls into this category, and I&#39;d actually classify their menu more like a &#34;Mexican-inspired&#34; one instead.There&#39;s a good mix of options, from pork carnitas to spicy chicken in any form you desire, be it bowl, burrito, taco or quesadilla. The prices are also quite good, but not as cheap as Berlin often is; a meal + drink should top out around 8-10 EUR.A word of advice- get there EARLY if you plan on going on the weekend. I went this past Sunday and there was a line out the door before they even opened. The last thing I thought of eating in Germany was Mexican food... but I am glad I did. This place is like chipotle only 10x better. I ordered a Vegan burrito and it was full of flavor and could feed a small country. They have a crazy selection of salsas and a menu to please all types of diets. Portions are huge, food is fresh and everything is seasoned just right. This place does so well it might need a bigger space, which is the only thing holding this place back. Other then that this place is awesome and will be coming back next time I&#39;m in Berlin. I&#39;ve been abroad and craving Mexican food for a while. This place is decent. I had a chicken burrito and was not disappointed. It&#39;s not great, but I was happy. Huge burrito for under €10. The atmosphere is enjoyable and the employees were nice. The burrito was very good but not great like the other competitor I know. And the burrito smelled a little bite plasticky to me but everything else was fine. There was a seating area inside and outside and when I was here it was moderately full. The prices aren&#39;t really cheap, one burrito for 5.00€...It used to be 3.00€. But anywho it&#39;s cool there. Comfy seats to sit at and a cool map on the walls. A Calimex burrito joint in Berlin is novelty to me. It&#39;s the last place I&#39;d expect to eat at thousands of miles away from its Golden State origins, but I felt the need to give Dolores&#39; burritos a taste. FOODThere are six kinds of burritos to choose from, two being vegan. If none of them sound appetizing, you have the option to customize your burrito or other foods on the menu, such as quesadillas, burrito bowls, soups, and salads. Classic Guacamole: The size of the burrito caught me off guard because it&#39;s humongous. Can I say that it even made me feel a little homesick for American portions? Wrapped in a flour tortilla were veggies, sour cream, salsa verde, rice, and black beans. For a meat-free burrito, it was very good. Its flavor can be attributed to the freshness of ingredients. Corn Chips: How can anyone screw  up corn chips? I don&#39;t know, but someone at Dolores did. The burrito was on the spot, but the chips missed the target, big time! No flavor whatsoever. SERVICEStaff is pretentious and looks down on non-native German speakers who attempt to speak the language (why am I not surprised?). They also make a big deal about bringing your own beverages into the restaurant. The guy manning the register came up to our table and told us to hide our bottles of water because they sell their own beverages. I guess he didn&#39;t want my bottle of tap water to compete against their freshly made juices. RESTAURANTTiny spot with limited seating on the inside, and a few benches on the outside. Lines can stretch all the way to the end of the restaurant. Most people seem to phone in their orders in advance and drop by for pick-up. OVERALLRating is more of a 3.50/5.0. The burritos are decent for this side of the world, but European or not , I have a feeling the Cali folks I know may think otherwise. Service stinks, but at least they&#39;re quick about preparing orders. Another trip is likely, but it will have to be at the new location. Yeah, baby! Want a burrito in Berlin? Want a burrito full of soy meat goodness? Want some unbelievably good red lentil and apricot soup? Check out this joint. I would give this place five stars, but they fluffed our order slightly (no guac for me; no cheese for BF), their tortilla chips appear to be deep-fried, and their burritos could use less rice and more veggies, just like at Chipotle. But who are we kidding, you&#39;ll be back for more. It may be my mad love for Tex-Mex, but these burritos don&#39;t compare. To up the flavor, you pay for every add on; it&#39;s just not the spicy wraps of Chipotle. We stumbled across this place and were pleasantly surprised! Packed with Mitte hipsters, we assumed it was a popular hang out. Great food. I had a burrito that was stuffed full of fresh ingredients and was very tasty! Would go back again. I was very excited for the hype and the prospects of a mission-style burrito! I&#39;m very sorry to say, it is hype - burritos at Dolores are what you would settle for at a mall food court, when you are too hungry to find something better. And I don&#39;t mean a mall in California or Arizona. The portions are large but bland, with an off-putting uniformly mushy texture.The chips were soggy with oil, cold, and too salty. I had a ton left over, especially given the ludicrously tiny serving of guacamole. They did make nice next-day chilaquiles.I&#39;m giving an extra star for all the variations for people with dietary restrictions! Oh, and there&#39;s Anchor Steam in the fridge! I had the chicken burrito with rice, black beans, Guac, cheese, salsa verde and of course chicken. Food came out pretty quick. You can watch the masters at work make your food if you wish. Ample seating and a great atmosphere. Next time in Berlin, I will be back. I was skeptical about this place as well.  Burrito&#39;s in Germany?  Besides, why eat something here that is common back home? Let me tell you right off I ate a lot of really good burrito&#39;s growing up in California, where some say the burrito was born/created by Mexican immigrants.  So that made me a bit hesitant going here as well.  But on a rainy afternoon why not try something you won&#39;t normally get?   Well, these guys running this place must have been to California as well, as they get it right.  They are set up where you select different items.  The menu is posted above the action so it is easy to figure out and plan out what you want.  Of course the choices can be a bit overwhelming.  I mean you are trying to decided what goes with what for the best taste, right?  For those of you needing guidance, there are some &#34;preset&#34; burrito designs.  Also makes it easy to order in a hurry instead of going through the 4 steps it takes to order something custom.  This part of the menu is also in English for our tourist types.  We had a carnitas burrito, with black beans, lime cilantro rice with salsa.  All very tasty and worked will together.  The Carnitas was more of the mexican variety rather than Caribbean, which is a plus in my book, but could have used just a little more spice, but was a good version, just not the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Which is ok, 5000 miles from home.  Size was impressive and those of you watching your portion sizes, split it with a friend.  Those of you hitting this place after the bars, your munchy alcohol induced hunger will be satisfied.  The number of tables is small, so my suggestion is bring a friend.  Have the friend grab a table while you handle the order and then you both sit down to enjoy a pretty damn find burrito.  They also have quesadillas and &#34;taco&#34; bowls, but stay with the burrito and you won&#39;t be sad. Delicious burritos! I was staying at a hostel just up the street and was very happy to find a burrito place with vegan options. I ordered the vegan lover burrito and it was fantastic! Spicy and with lots of flavour! The sauce made it for me. A good sized burrito as well for 6.50€. I came on a Thursday night and the place was packed. The staff were very friendly and worked quickly to fill everyone&#39;s orders. Highly recommend! Damn good Tex-Mex!Food is great!  Been eating there for years and it&#39;s still the place I go for Tex-Mex.Although the place can get pretty crowded, the staff tries to be friendly throughout the chaotic flow of customers -ya, they get real busy sometimes.  No worries with the waiting though... They have a number on the receipt and a digital number board that keeps you updated. We resisted anything American (yes - TexMex &amp; Mission-style is American) when we first move to Berlin. It lasted about 2 months, and Dolores is the place we caved to. Berlin has got the goods on food and cheap bites are the city&#39;s specialty, but good Mexican food is scarce. When we arrived in Berlin in 2007 restaurants billed as Mexican were more often Spanish - or not even close. Today&#39;s growing taquerias are getting closer, but pickles in the salsa, poorly treated tortillas, and an absolutely pathetic spice level still has us missing the Mexican food of home.We were excited to try this place, based on San Francisco Mission style Mexican. We were surprised to enter and find a cooler Chipotle-style restaurant. Ian ordered a burrito with beef, awesome cream (Ian&#39;s re-named sour cream FYI), and an unusual spicy peanut sauce. I went for a burrito bowl, which most resembled nachos with house-made corn chips, corn salsa, and mole tofu. Burrito bowl is undoubatably the best bang for your buck. Innovation &amp;amp; flavor! Not authentic to Mexico, but some seriously tasty food for under 5 euro. Dolores, we are in your debt.We had a real &#34;America-Fuck Yeah&#34; eating kind of weekend actually as we also went to the Bird. Ah, memories. They recently re-did their menu &amp; while there are more options, I am a little ambivalent about it. I&#39;ll have to visit again soon &amp; re-evaluate.

//Text for Restaurant3's Personality (Yelp reviews of Fassbender and Rausch)
RESTAURANT3_TEXT=Second visit was just as great as the first!!!This time I tried the mini chocolate mousse tort with gold leaf and a half and half mocha. Lucky to get a table today as the place was jammed. Had a lovely view over the Gendarmenmarkt from our table.This place will make you drooool! I guess I like my chocolate a little more refined.  And what I mean by that is I prefer it to be more silky.  I found this chocolate to be a bit gritty.However, the first floor with all the chocolate sculptures was quite a bit of fun to look at.BTW, you can pretty much get anything from the first floor as you would from the second floor if you are just looking for chocolate. But for the money, I think it&#39;s overpriced (at least in the restaurant). The desserts weren&#39;t as disappointing as the service.Our walking tour of Berlin made a stop by this chocolate shop and he recommended we come back for a quick bite. Three hours later we found ourselves at a table overlooking the square. The service however didn&#39;t match the view.First off, he took a long time to ever come by our table. When placing our order, he was obviously annoyed we only ordered one drink, despite ordering multiple desserts. He brought over the wrong dessert initially and we politely replied we ordered something else. He responded with a sarcastic, &#34;Are you sure?&#34; When we asked for the check, he dropped it off at the table, bluntly said, &#34;Service not included&#34; and walked away. He was just so rude and inconsiderate the whole time.The desserts weren&#39;t that bad, although not life changing either. We ordered the tray of chocolates and a Mozart Symphony. The chocolates were good, although three of them tasted exactly the same despite having completely different shapes. The other dessert was an interesting mix of nutty and chocolatey, although I think I would pass next time. Fassbender &amp; Rausch is a great place! We visited in August 2015 during our weekend in Berlin and we were pleasantly surprised! The store is great and has an enormous variety of chocolate products (figures, desserts, cakes, pralines, barks, thins, bars etc).  We also visited the chocolate cafe, the cakes were amazing as well as the mint hot chocolate. This is a great place to go and splurge on a unique cuisine. The food is great and they don&#39;t overdo it with the chocolate...but it definitely is rich and indulgent because of the hints of chocolate so be prepared!  My husband got a soup (forget the name) but it had a curry taste and exotic fruit and hints of dark chocolate. Absolutely scrumptious!  Our main entrees of the filets of sea bass and lobster stew were good too. We ended by splitting a chocolate mousse torte...highly recommend to split dessert if you do an entire meal there or else it may feel like chocolate overload. Well worth a visit for any chocolate lover. There is a beautiful showroom and retail shop on the main floor, then you can take the glass elevator (very Willy Wonka) to the upper level restaurant and cafe for a meal or ice cream treat.This is not bargain basement chocolate, so not the best place to have your kids shop to their heart&#39;s content. But as a chocolate emporium it was absolutely lovely. Highlights were definitely the structures of famous Berlin landmarks as well as animals, volcanoes, airplanes, etc. which were made out of chocolate and wafers. Every where you looked, you see another cool object.When in Paris, I absolutely loved seeing all the macaroons lined up in the bakery cases. At Fassbender &amp; Rauch, they welcome you to their &#39;praline paradise&#39; with 200 different types of pralines available in the world&#39;s longest praline counter. Kind of overwhelming and extraordinary at the same time. DEFINITELY GET THE HOT CHOCOLATE!! The best I&#39;ve ever had in my life -- it was so rich and creamy and not too sweet. The view over Gendarmenmarkt is also fabulous... If you love chocolate then this place would be your nirvana. Floor to ceiling with truffles, chocolate,  tea, sweets, drinking chocolate and all other manner of sweet goodness. Second floor cafe allows you to sample the cakes etc. The tiramusu torte and my rum drinking chocolate were amazing. Got some treasures yo take home. Glad we took the time to visit. This was the first thing I saw in the morning and the last place I saw at night from my hotel room across the street. As a chocoholic, this meant trouble...in a very good way!They have an amazing assortment of chocolates. The store is big and is full of sweet treats. Hansel and Gretel would be delighted to be here. They have models of Berlin monuments, cupid, airplanes...all made of chocolate!They have individually wrapped candies that you can mix and match. You can also customize a box with whatever bon bons and truffles that you want in whatever size box. I did a few boxes of hazelnut chocolates. Whatever chocolate they had that contains hazelnut went in all 4 big boxes. I also got 1kg of dark chocolate with hazelnut bark and 1kg of milk chocolate with hazelnut bark - they were whole hazelnuts held on together with a big of chocolate so, you get more nuts than chocolate. They also have this unbelievable Florentine that was absolutely delightful. Crisp, light and not very sweet. The best I&#39;ve had.As if I didn&#39;t have enough chocolates, I also got bars of milk chocolate with layers of hazelnut cream in between. So soft and creamy. You can freeze it if you don&#39;t want a soft, melty, gooey mess.You just can&#39;t walk out of this store without getting anything. I was here about twice a day while in Berlin. Can I move in here and gorge on 80% dark chocolate (starting at only 0.90 E for a stick and under 3 E for a 100g bar) and boxes of marzipan (10-12 E) while staring at the chocolate models of the Bradenburger Tor and Berlin Wall all day?They have cute shapes of chocolate too, which are great for gifts.  If only I could fit the large chocolate motorcycle in my luggage.  Had to opt for the more space-economical bears.  They also have lady bugs, Porches, Volkswagens, and mini Brandenburger Tors. This place was horrible.It was horrible for my wallet.  It was horrible for my waistline.  It was horrible when it came time to hit the hotel fitness center in the evening.  Everything here is delicious.  And they gave us free samples.And then there&#39;s that misleadingly beautiful elevator to what they call the Chocolate-cafe upstairs.  Oh... you think the Chocolate-cafe at a famous German chocolatier would just be a quaint dessert shop - perhaps some gelato or coffees and cakes generously garnished with chocoalte, maybe an eiskaffee - but it&#39;s a fricken full sit down restaurant and it&#39;s delicious.  A completely seasonal menu and most of the dishes, of course, feature chocolate in some way.I&#39;d like to point out that having decided to splurge on accomodations by staying at the Hilton Berlin right next door did not help us restrain our visits to Fassbender &amp; Rausch in the few days we were here.  And here come the chocolate sweats... The store is really fun, even if you just want to look around. A great place to bring visitors as it&#39;s right next the beautiful Gendarmenmarkt Square. They have many Berlin landmarks made out of chocolate in an impressive scale. The chocolate is fancy but not too expensive. They sell a huge variety and the few I&#39;ve had are very, very good. The white chocolate is amazing. I&#39;m not a marzipan fan but theirs is delicious, plus so many great souvenirs!If you have time, go upstairs and have some cake and a beverage. The line can be long even on a weekday but there are many seats and quick turn over so don&#39;t be discouraged. Get a hot chocolate and some cake. They are truly amazing, probably best to share because it gets to be a lot. The hot chocolate is rich but not too sweet and there are many options for flavors. This is chocolate lovers&#39; dream shop. You can scan the store upon walking in and see at least 4 different chocolate sculptures, ranging from 2 feet to 6 feet tall, of various Berlin landmarks. Resist the urge to bite into any of them, as they keep the air laden with the smell of chocolate. As a chocolate lover, find some indulgences for yourself. As a visitor, this is an easy place to find gifts for the chocoholics in your life.The store itself looks like a larger version of those miniature village shops that you see as decorations around Christmastime. It&#39;s quaint and traditional, but solidly upscale. You&#39;ll find a wide variety of dark (bitter), milk (vollmilch), and white (weisser) chocolate. They do a LOT of varieties with pralines, as well as a great selection of chocolate models -- there&#39;s the obligatory Berlin landmarks, like the Reichstag building or the Brandenberg Gate, or something a little more whimsical like a high heel or a racecar. Don&#39;t miss the deli-like counter where you can create your own collection of truffles, or get pieces of what look like peanut brittle but is actually made with caramelized almonds and chocolate.There is a cafe on the second floor, but we stayed on the first level where the shop is.The staff is friendly and helpful, and speaks English as you might expect in this tourist-heavy district. It&#39;s definitely worth the stop to indulge your sweet tooth! HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO GERMAN CHOCOLATE HEAVEN? This is the place. You must visit this shop if you&#39;re ever in Berlin. Any kind of chocolate you can think of and it is ALL SO DELICIOUS. We came in December and the entire store was decked .. just like the entire country because Germans love Christmas. It really made the entire shopping experience even more festive .. which means we might have went overboard in shopping but we do no regret it. Get the basic chocolate square flakes. Chocolate at its OG state without any added flavors. I also got a variety pack in a beautiful cardboard chest to bring back to the office as souvenirs. My husband got a customized assorted box of truffles, where the lovely friendly lady helped us pick out. There are so many options. What type of chocolate? Ganache? Truffle? Praline? Fruity? Alcoholic? Coffee? Savory? All of the above?After tasting chocolate from this shop, you can just throw all those Hershey bars away. On another level, people! Also, stop by the cafe on the second floor. Try to catch the daily lunch/afternoon special. DO NOT leave this place without having a hot chocolate. Definitely worth a visit! I went there with some friends to try out the &#34;world&#39;s best hot chocolate&#34; as named by Buzzfeed. The cafe is big and they have a whole menu of sweet and savory dishes, all made with chocolate. Anyway, the hot chocolate was pretty high quality -- not like the best ever, but decent. It was a little more on the pricey side (~5€), but the store is pretty fancy + it&#39;s in a nice area, so I get it. The street level store is pretty cool too, they have lots of cool chocolate sculptures as well as pricey chocolate gifts. I don&#39;t think I will regularly go here, but it&#39;s worth stopping by once, if only to take a peek at the store. While we were in Berlin for the day, we had lunch at Fassbender &amp; Rausch, a chocolatier in Gendarmenmarkt. The chocolate shop is on the first floor, and the restaurant &amp; cafe is on the second floor. We grabbed a table, which already had menus, and a server came by to ask us if we wanted anything to drink. Tap water is available.Complimentary bread was served with a chocolate and mustard-esque spread. There were only four entree options on the menu, so we ordered all four for variety; and then two desserts, since after all, this is a chocolate shop.German Apple-Fed Pork - 13,50 € (~$18)Havelländer Apfelschwein pork pan-fried and served with fine milk chocolate sprinkled atop risotto. The best thing was probably the risotto.Aromatic Beef Salad  - 16,50 € (~$22)Tender strips of flavorful roast beef with fine dark chocolate Grenada 65% on a bed of lollo bionda lettuce, sweetcorn, pepper, tomato and pineapple, flavored with garlic and coriander.Fillets of Sea Bass - 12,50 € (~$17)Sea bass pan-fried in cocoa butter with tomatoes, lamb&#39;s lettuce, lemongrass and white chocolate, served with leek-and-mascarpone-stuffed pasta. This was my least favored dish.Pan-Fried Corn-Fed Chicken  - 17,50 € (~$24)Served on a bed of sweet potato mash and a chocolate and walnut sauce made from fine milk chocolate Madanga 39%, this was probably my favorite dish.Caramel Ice Cream with Dark Chocolate - 7,50 € (~$10)The best one! Three scoops of caramel ice cream with fine dark chocolate El Cuador 70% and banana slicesVanilla Ice Cream with Strawberries - 6,80 € (~$9)Three scoops of Bourbon vanilla ice cream with strawberries and fine dark chocolate El Cuador 70%. Very good.It was strange eating savory food with chocolate but I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to doing it again. The chocolate worked well in most of the dishes and as someone who isn&#39;t even fond of chocolate, I enjoyed my lunch here. However, the total came to over $100 USD for four people and I can&#39;t say it was completely worth it. Definitely a bit overpriced, but isn&#39;t that the case with everything in Europe? A great stop for a chocolate lover but it is quite tourit&#39;y. It is very lovely and a great stop for photos with giant chocolate replicas of all the local tourist stops, but the place isn&#39;t cheap so be careful if bringing the children. No history of chocolate or anything of that sort like you&#39;ll find in Spain, but still a nice stop if you are in the area. I love their hot chocolate and their cakes look amazing! One word describes this place: HEAVENIf you like chocolate you will be happy in here, the people behind the counters (where you order chocolate individually) are very nice and provide good suggestions on what you should take depending on the type of taste you have.Every visit to Berlin must have a visit to Fassbender &amp; Rausch! This place is great for souvenirs! You can &#34;build your own&#34; box of chocolates from their large selection in the case (there must be hundreds). My friends and family loved this, because I got to personalize the choices based on what they like. Also, the designs on the individual chocolates are much more pretty than the prepackaged boxes (I also believe the prices were comparable). While I was there, I went upstairs and ate &#34;lunch.&#34; I had a hot chocolate (dark...can&#39;t remember the name but the waiter suggested it) and one of their chocolate mousse creations from the menu. Both were very delicious. I&#39;m taking off 1 star because the hostess upstairs and the woman working the front register were not very friendly. Classic place to visit when visiting Berlin. Great selection of chocolates downstairs, beautifully wrapped and fantastic gifts to bring home. The highlight, though, is the cafe upstairs. The spicy hot chocolate is thick, rich, complex, and their desserts are the perfect size for a mid-afternoon indulgence. Highly recommended. If you love chocolate, you can&#39;t go wrong with this place. So many different chocolate combinations, we spent about one hour figuring out what we wanted :) We also checked out the cafe/restaurant upstairs. I was a bit confused why the cafe and restaurant were separate on the website, because it was just one large space. I&#39;m thinking that in that area you can either just have a drink or order a full meal. That makes it a cafe/restaurant hybrid? We order meals, while the people next to us just had some drinks. The meals with chocolate incorporated into them were excellent, but sometimes hard to distinguish the cocoa taste in the meals, which to me defeats the purpose of going to a restaurant like this one. Also provide free wifi for one hour, you have to ask you server and they bring you over user names and passwords for each person. Would come one for the experience, but probably would not return to the restaurant. My companion and I were out last night to attend a string quartet performance at the nearby concert hall, and as we were walking from the metro station to our destination, we walked past this establishment. My companion told me we should get chocolates, so I was pulled into this shop a few minutes before they were closing. I later realized that this is perhaps the best time to visit this place, when all the tourists have left and the place is almost empty. The influx of tourists in this shop is actually the thing that discourages me from venturing in in other times.But now I realize why. It is a very swanky chocolate factory. You can see Berlin&#39;s landmarks made in chocolate. You can sit down and eat at a cafe upstairs. But for last night, all we wanted was a small bag of chocolates, so we made a small selection from the huge array of truffles and bonbons on display.The shop looks very expensive from the outside, and their goods are very exquisite. Every bite was definitely worth it. And from what I can tell, the prices were rather reasonable as well. I&#39;ll definitely be back. This is a much stop for any chocolate lover. The store and market are GREAT for gifts and treats and seeing giant structures made of chocolate - photo opportunity!The restaurant can be crazy at dinner time and require reservations. Go for lunch! I am not sure how, but I convinced my diabetic husband we must eat here. We tried 3 small dishes - the salad, meatballs and chicken skewers --- all with chocolate worked in and all tasted great and not too odd. And without requiring too much additional insulin. :)It was a unique experience to have chocolate in each savory dish and encourage everyone to give it a try. Thank you Fassbender &amp; Rausch... You single handedly added about 2-3 pounds to the scale. I like simple chocolate bars, dark, white... you name it. This chocolatier by far have BEST chocolate I have ever tasted. They have chocolate from beans spread across the globe that have very unique taste profiles. Struggling to find something to bring back for friends and family? done! The chocolate store on the ground floor offers a huge selection of chocolates, you could find anything you can think of, a great option if you&#39;re looking to get a formal gift or a nice souvenir.The cafe on the first floor offers cold drinks, hot drinks and a variety of cakes (no savory). It was our first time there so we ordered their famous hot chocolate and all the cakes that looked good on the menu (their menu includes pics of everything offered which was really helpful). The hot chocolate with whipped cream was really good, the cakes were generally good but I recommend the Mousse au Chocolat-törtchen, the Herren-törtchen, and the Schwarze Johannisbeer-törtchen.Staff was very friendly and the place is wheelchair accessible. My review is about the cafe which is on the 2nd floor. You missed it? Didn&#39;t know about its existence? Now there&#39;s a reason to go again.So how do you know a place is good? When there&#39;s a crowd waiting on line wanting to get in. Yes, we had to wait for about 20 mins before they found a place for us. We have heard about Fassbender &amp; Rausch before and waiting was totally acceptable. So finally we were seated. The staff was very nice and helping! We&#39;ve ordered different types of cakes - I got the marzipan törtchen (see the picture) - it was really good and if you&#39;re a marzipan lover like myself, you&#39;d love it. Don&#39;t really remember what my mates ordered, but everything surely looked stunning. Perfect food presentation and excellent service.Ask the waiter for username/password for 30mins free Wi-Fi. A must when visiting Germany.  I can&#39;t imagine having actual food here but the dessert and drinks are so yummy with an incredible view and a dangerously cool chocolate shop below. The quality of chocolate here is very good, but you should definitely stop in if you need a unique gift.  They have lots of different pre-made packs and chocolates in the shape of Berlin monuments for sale.  You have your choice of boozy and plain chocolate balls.  Stay away from &#34;fondant&#34; flavor if you&#39;re not into the booze-filled version.  The &#34;butter&#34; flavors were all divine and very rich. Best Chocolate I ever had!!! Better than Lindt or Godiva by far.Huge store near Checkpoint Charlie and the Wall.Saw the chocolate volcano and depictions of famous local landmarks.They had plenty of attentive sales people around, they let you wander and pleasant and knowledgable.Prices are very reasonable. Oh how I loved my truffles from Fassbender &amp; Raush!!! I wish they had stores in the US... They have more than 200+ kinds of chocolates to choose from. My favorite was Dark chocolate champagne truffle and Dark chocolate truffle with raspberry center. Their chocolates are much better than Godiva, I think. The store looks expensive from outside, but it&#39;s actually very reasonable, a box of 12 truffles came out to about 9 euro. I can&#39;t wait to go back to Fassbender next time I&#39;m in Berlin!! One of my must-do items on my German checklist was to consume good chocolate.  This place had it and more.  The ground floor had a huge array of chocolates and chocolate sculptures (Titanic, Brandenburg Tor, etc.) while the upper floor housed a cafe with delightful desserts and coffee.  I greatly enjoyed my coffee and cake and bought a ton of the individually wrapped chocolates to take home as a consumable souvenir. The sculptures made out of chocolate are unbelievable!  They have a functional chocolate volcano with flowing chocolate lava.  Amazingly delicious chocolate!!  Do not miss this unique chocolatier. The blackcurrant cake is unbelievable. Try it with some Darjeeling; you won&#39;t be sorry! I found it much more exciting to my palate than the chocolate cake, which somehow didn&#39;t do it for me once I got past the dark candy coating. This is probably the best chocolate shop I have ever been too. There was an incredible selection of chocolates to purchase, ranging from small boxes all the way up to giant, expensive, gifts. We picked up a few different ones to try and they were all absolutely top notch.The decor is also stunning - there are chocolate models of planes, ships and even the Reichstag! Fantastic. The overall feel is very fancy, very high-end.After buying the chocolate, we went upstairs to the cafe for some hot chocolate and a cake. It blew me away, totally. The best hot chocolate on the planet.Definitely come here - both to get gifts for other people back home AND gifts for yourself! This place is essentially a chocolate Disneyland. Nothing not to love. Located right off the U Banh right in the heart of the Gendermarket, this chocolate store boasts itself as the largest chocolate store in Germany (I believe) and so we had to check it out for ourselves.The chocolate store has a huge selection of goods everything from truffles to hot cocoa ranging in price as well. Particularly fun for all ages are the large scale chocolate displays of the TV Tower, Titantic, Parliament, etc. We bought various souvenirs for our friends and family downstairs and then headed upstairs to the cafe for desserts and coffee. With a great view of the Gendermarket we were able to enjoy our hot chocolates, coffees, and freshly made desserts.I would definitely recommend this place for a coffee break after sightseeing in Berlin. FYI, the chocolate store closes at 8pm, (we learned that the hard way after arriving at 8:15... =) The waiter told me that i would not need dinner tonight given my choice of chocolatecake, he was right. Dont think i ever need to eat again. If you love chocolate this place is a must!!! Great chocolate for a reasonable price! Service is quick once you get the waiters attention, however it is a bit hard to get contact. Anyway i m here for the chocolate and the chocolate is great!! Wonderful chocolate store!The shop downstairs is filled with sculptures -- a giant bear, the Titanic, Brandenburg Gate, all made entirely of chocolate! There is an incredible selection of chocolate souvenirs, truffles, tortes, pralines, and pastries. Upstairs is the cafe, and we ordered a hot chocolate, a couple of mini tortes, and an iced mocha. These weren&#39;t the best desserts that I have ever had, but they were really great! I think the downstairs shopping experience was a bit more memorable than the cafe upstairs, but I would definitely recommend both! I had the most decadent hot chocolate of my life in there upstairs cafe. For a hot chocolate I guess it was a tad on the pricey side but hey I&#39;m on holiday and given the touristy location it was to be expected. What I especially loved, and this is true of most of Europe, is that they don&#39;t automatically add milk to your hot chocolate so it is pure thick chocolatey goodness, and as someone who counts lactose amongst their personal enemies this is a huge bonus.Yes the store&#39;s a tad touristy but it is definitely worth a visit and children will love it. Go if only to view the amazing Berlin landmarks made out of chocolate. This user has arrived from Qype, a company acquired by Yelp in 2012.

//Text for Restaurant4's Personality (Yelp reviews of Schnitzelei)
RESTAURANT4_TEXT=I&#39;ve eaten here twice now, and have really enjoyed it both times. Tonight&#39;s meal was one of the best I&#39;ve had in Berlin! I had the lamb hüftschnitzel, which was perfectly cooked lamb medallions, fingerling potatoes, and bacon green beans. The lamb was excellent, perfectly cooked as said. It was mild in flavor, and I did feel it needed a smidge of salt, but I devoured it. Beans were delicious as were the potatoes. My wife and daughter had two different breaded schnitzels, and my son had the creamy mushroom sauce schnitzel. They all loved theirs as well.We also enjoyed some of their tapas to start. They serve these in cool little dishes on a wooden board, and you see them getting served as you go in and start to salivate. This was great too. Good beers and a full list of cocktails are available. They also start you off with a small free beer (and apple juice for the kids). I even had a decent espresso (I&#39;m a total snob on this, so was an unusual order/place to order one for me, but, after a long day I was in need... Then it was on to beer :)I think the only downside I&#39;ve seen for me is the location. We&#39;re over on the east side so this is a little bit of a hike to get to, but I think totally worth it. The restaurant also has a style and feel that I really like - it&#39;s more upscale, but no white linens. So, you feel it&#39;s nicer, but at the same time it&#39;s very comfortable. There&#39;s a nice warm sort of &#34;glow&#34; to the interior which is great. I definitely recommend it. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, although they could have been a little more attentive. Free beer when we were seated, along with a basket of bread which was great.We got the Weiner Schnitzel and the Lamb Shanks. Both of which were excellent.Just don&#39;t make the mistake of ordering extra tapas (like we did) although the tapas was tasty, the portion sizes for the main courses were massive, so the extra food was unnecessary. Will definitely eat here again. At Schnitzelei they serve a variety of schnitzels, and we had the classic Wiener schnitzel. It was really tasty and well prepared. The only con is that the location is a bit off and that the staff wasn&#39;t a so attentive. But the schnitzel was great! Great food and great service with an authentic german feel.Definitely worth a visit! A+ i came here for a late lunch on Saturday.  They do ressies via Opentable which was convenient.  Super friendly staff, we were greeted to our table with some house apple cider.  YUM!  Two of us shared the 6 tapas (can&#39;t remember them all but the memorable ones were the veal burgers, meatballs, curry sausage - mostly the popular items) and a weiner schnitzel.  It was A LOT of food but I&#39;m sure we could have gone with more since it was all so flavorful.  They have a great cocktail/drinks menu and all the food is extremely reasonably priced.  Highly recommend!  The only reason why I gave it one star less is because they allow dogs inside the restaurant - I&#39;m not against dogs but I felt like it wasn&#39;t very sanitary to have dog hair flying around everywhere, especially in your dining area. Must go! Excellent service...amazing German food! Great place!! The staff was polite and attentive. Great prices for what you get.The German style tapas is an amazing idea - and they all tasted so good!!!! I rarely go to upscale restaurants; paying 20 EUR for a meal doesn&#39;t happen often for me (I&#39;m more a 12 EUR guy). But, every now and then, there are exceptions, so when the Yelp brigade thought we needed schnitzels, we headed here one evening. We were all given pre-meal drinks; that was a great touch of hospitality in my opinion. Berliner kindl (the local beer) was the choice, but in case you don&#39;t drink alcohol, they are more than happy to give you something else to moisten your palate. We were a big group of 9, and a table has been reserved for us. Of course, I ordered a Jägerschnitzel, which was 16 EUR, paired with a large beer. That set me back 19,50 EUR plus tip. The food was stellar. The schnitzel was well cooked, and I enjoyed every bit of it, including the sauteed mushrooms and the spätzle that accompanied it. Other folks ordered the Wiener schnitzel, and I found it great that they wrapped the lemon slice in cheesecloth so that when you squeeze it, it doesn&#39;t get all over yourself.So yes, I am a fan. The ambience was great, modern design, the acoustics of the room was set in such that the voices don&#39;t echo all over; in other words, you can still hear your tablemates. The restrooms were cavernous. The only reason I am deducting a star is because they needed better knives. I had to exert some force slicing my schnitzel, even though it wasn&#39;t tough at all, but the knife I was given just couldn&#39;t do it. I am supposed to be gaining calories when I eat, not losing them. What a beautiful place! The service was great- our server was supported by the rest of the house staff to give us a great experience.We were given complimentary pilsners which was very thoughtful.  I also ordered a cocktail, but I&#39;m sad to say that this may have been the only factor leading to a subtraction of one star.  I may just be too used to stronger cocktails from the US, but I&#39;d pass on the cocktails and opt for beer instead.  We had the tapas to start- bacon wrapped plums.  I&#39;m used to bacon wrapped dates, but to be honest with you, these were just as good.  Who would have thought?I then had the veal schnitzelei- amazing!  It was enormous (maybe 8 inches x 12 inches?)  but it was fried? to perfection.  Each bite had hints of mayonnaise (you are lying to yourself if you don&#39;t like the taste of mayo)  I also got a side of the potato salad- which was also good, but just a little too much in terms of quantity after the main course.My boyfriend got the beef schnitzelei, which was actually a steak.  They never did ask him how he wanted it cooked, but it came out perfect.  I was on a dessert kick when I traveled in Europe so we got the ice cream trio.  If I wasn&#39;t intent on trying dessert from every country, I would have passed on a 3rd course as I was already very full.  But, I was not disappointed and each ice cream (I forgot the flavors now) were delicious.Overall the food, atmosphere, and service were excellent.  I would definitely come back here again. Great service and ambience, very good food and generally an extremely enjoyable dining experience along simple lines. The vfm offered by the German Tapas is excellent and I imagine that you could happily spend a few hours watching the Spree flow by from the terrace when the weather&#39;s warm enough. They could though do with adding Bloody Mary to the list of cocktails. I should have known to make a reservation,  but for some reason, after a long day of sight-seeing, it completely slipped my mind. Luckily, we didn&#39;t even need one. The host and hostesses were incredibly accommodating, sitting us at an inside table almost immediately. As if that wasn&#39;t good enough, shortly after sitting down inside, they informed us that a table in the outside patio had opened up and we were welcome to move out there. Nice!The atmosphere, especially out on the patio is very pleasant. Despite the fact that Berlin was in the middle of a ridiculous heat wave during our visit - more akin to Texas weather than northern Europe - the patio is amply shaded by trees so it&#39;s very nice.What to order? Schnitzel, obviously. The menu has about 10 or so different versions and variations of schnitzel. I&#39;ve been to Austria twice, and tried countless schnitzels. None compare to the one(s) I had, and sampled, here. I am so glad I came here during my brief stay in Berlin, or else I&#39;d still have the misguided notion that schnitzel is a boring, tasteless piece of meat. Not only was this a surprisingly pleasant, thoroughly enjoyable meal, I have to say it was revelatory. Don&#39;t save your schnitzel experience for Vienna, come here! Great food. Friendly service. You get greeted with a small welcome beer. Big portion. Prices are moderate and the food is definitely worth it. Absolutely delicious! My father and I had read good reviews and came on a whim, without a reservation. We were seated inside immediately and served a tapas-portion of beer as soon as we sat down. The service was very friendly and, of course, our waiter spoke perfect English and they have English menus. The Weinerschnitzel is the best I&#39;ve ever had. Well worth the visit! The two previous English Language Reviews made me decide to make Schnitzelei our pre-Opera destination, as I was hankering for one last authentic German meal before heading home from Berlin.When the previous reviews are so glowing it is easy to nit-pick or be disappointed in some way because the expectation level is so high, but I&#39;m pleased to say everything was excellent and I have absolutely no complaints.  From the moment we walked in at 5:45, sans reservation, and was told a table was available as long as we understood it was reserved by another party at 8:00, to the stylish and much appreciated small welcome beer, to the ambience which is really quite delightful for a place where the mains are in the high teens, to the main course which were the best schnitzels we&#39;ve ever had, to the service which was engaging and friendly throughout, this was a great place to be.  This may have just been luck of the draw, or the time of year (mid January), but all the tables around us were German speakers.  If you are looking for a classy place for great German food that is a cut above for both atmosphere and service, I heartily recommend Schnitzelei! Wow wow wow!!!Großartiger Service, großartiges Personal und großartiges Essen!!!Das wird wohl unser neuer Laden! The staff speaks English and they are super friendly. Already winning for me. But they also serve food later than many restaurants, beer on tap, and the food is awesome. Cured ham and bacon sauerkraut, definitely recommend. Melt-in-your-mouth schnitzel. Great atmosphere! Tucked away from the busy civilization of Berlin, this restaurant is found on the northern ends of the quiet and residential neighborhood of Charlottenburg. It&#39;s situated right by the river Spree.My exhausted friends and I, looking confused and lost (none of us spoke German other than making out what we could), were welcomed by their warm service and free beer (apparently a staple here). Complimentary free bread basket was amazingly delicious (rye and beer bread were the combination here).Food here is typical German/Austrian food, but not feeling like it&#39;s bar food. The schnitzel dishes are quite delicious (to me) and more than what I can eat. Prices are modest compared to the serving sizes (a lot of schnitzel). You&#39;re paying for the ambiance too, let&#39;s not forget.Very comfortable environment and noise is moderate (no shouting conversation).Service is a little slow in the beginning, but it was considerably busy at the dinner hour we were dining at. Several waiters/resses waited on us throughout the evening were helpful and quite attentive (without being in your face). One of them was nice enough to help us out with our dessert recommendations. It was endearing and made a nice memorable closure for the dining event.English is spoken very little here, but they do try. I don&#39;t expect anyone to speak English with me in a foreign place. I could have pointed at the menu and went along with it. That&#39;s when I am feeling ambitious and want to be surprised in a new foreign city. This is the best meal I have ever had in my life.  Also, make sure you come really hungry because you will want to make sure you make it through to dessert.  The prices themselves may be a little high by German standards for a neighborhood restaurant, but way lower than anything you will find in the Mitte, and crazy cheap by Chicago standards.  The food is a foodie take on German pub fare kicked up to the quality of haute cuisine.  and our server explained all the ingredients in there with pride and explained how the complimentary (and delicious) beer bread was baked in house.I will start with the ambiance.  It was moderate noise level and a  pretty packed house especially considering it was a Tuesday evening but we didn&#39;t have to worry about reservations or waiting.  The  decor had a the smooth lines or modern design, but also a lot of warmth and comfort from the natural wood and candle light.  I am not sure, but I kinda got the impression that it was more or less a popular neighborhood and local restaurant than a destination restaurant, which it easily could be as well.  While they are open until midnight be aware that the kitchen closes at 11pm so I recommend getting there by 9pm at the latest to make sure you can take in the full experience.Once we were sat, we were given small glasses of beer right away.  It took a little bit for our server to join us, but he was also waiting on a very large party in the room around the corner as well so that is easily forgivable.  He brought us bread right away.  Though obviously, I didn&#39;t expect our server to speak English, he did speak some (very well actually) and was able to explain the food to us through my translated version of the menu that we downloaded from their website.  If he didn&#39;t know the English word, he was willing to ask a coworker which I feel was above and beyond the call of duty.  While we placed our order he was more than willing to chime in with his honest opinion and helped us pick out some really amazing German style tapas.  All of the food was rich and oh so flavorful!   Make sure you get the bacon wrapped dates, and the Obatzda, I practically teared up because eating them were so delicious.  We, of course, had the schnitzel as a main course.  We ordered the small to share and only ate a third between the two of us because we were so full from the tapas, but it was wonderful.  The veal was so tender you didn&#39;t even need to bother with your knife.For dessert our server recommended the tapas size dessert trio and even though we were stuffed stilled managed to blow my mind.  My personal favorite was the ice cream schnitzel server with a pomegranate sauce (I&#39;m imagine the sauce changes seasonally), while my girlfriend loved the chocolate mousse, that was designed to emulate a candy popular among German youth.  After dessert we were presented with a complimentary digestif.  I am not sure if this is normal or if they just really liked us, but it was nice and helped settle all the food in my stomach.  Between the very nice ambiance, the attentive and patient service, and the amazing food, I would be willing to fly 5000 miles solely to eat at this restaurant again. A pretty sweet place! Unfortunately we went when it was cold, so we couldn&#39;t really sit outside and enjoy any of that, but I&#39;ll come back for it in the spring and summer. Anyway, inside, pretty cool as well. Service people were extremly friendly and also extremely attentive, something you don&#39;t get everywhere, especially in Berlin. We both skipped apetizers and had the Wiener Schnitzel, which despite the hefty price of 15,50 EUR easily helped Schnitzelei into my personal Top 5 of schnitzel places. ;-) I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s #1, #2, #3, #4 or #5 - but it was really, really good. The Schnitzel was veal, very fresh and thin. It came with a little cucumber salad and potatoe salad. As for drinks, they have a pretty comprehensive menu for everything alcoholic and non alcoholic, I had a beer and my buddy had a wine. For cocktails they also do whatever you want that is not on the menu. After the dinner we moved to pair of very comfy armchairs, had a smoke or two, a few more drinks and took it very, very easy. They closed down around 1:00 AM or something. We left at almost 2:00 AM and were never rushed us out, which is pretty nice as well. To Everyone at Schnitzel Haus, I normally don&#39;t write a review and will not do so here as I need to say THANK YOU for such an outstanding dining experience! I made a reservation for Monday 10/6/08 to celebrate my mother&#39;s 60th birthday. I was researching Bay Ridge restaurants as my mom still lives there and cannot travel far from home, and discovered the Schnitzel Haus and thought that perhaps something different from the standard steak place would be great. I currently live in Berlin and am already planning to bring visiting friends to the Schnitzel Haus in the near future. Outstanding and absolutely 5 stars!!! Thank you and we&#39;ll be seeing you soon! For the ambience, the sorroundings and the service I give five stars. The food is only three. But I will certainly come back to sit by the Spree a nice evening with the friendly waiters bringing the German/Austrian tapas (!) This user has arrived from Qype, a company acquired by Yelp in 2012.

//Text for Restaurant5's Personality (Yelp reviews of The Bird)
RESTAURANT5_TEXT=I was craving a really good, juicy, cheesy, mushroom burger that I never seemed to be able to find in Berlin.To cut things short, these guys probably have the best burger patties in Berlin. Only &#39;Burgermeister&#39; is a close contender, but that said The Bird does a better job when it comes to portion size.Deducting one star for the fries. It&#39;s homemade, but that&#39;s nothing to brag about given the way they made it - at least in the two times I visited. They were a bit oily and soggy. Perhaps they should get better potatoes. Food poisoning.  I went there yesterday,  September 6th at 5pm and had called in my order 20mins before arriving in hopes it would be complete.  We ended up waiting an additional 30 mins.I ordered a medium rare Bird House (mine) along with some mild wings and 2 other Bird houses (medium).I ate the burger and some hours later was throwing up, aches, pains, dizziness.  The doctor confirmed it was food poisoning.  Take care if you go to the bird. I will not return and neither will my friends. I had such HIGH expectations for this place but I was just simply not blown away by this place especially with all the reviews and the line. I had the gonazales burger which came with a HUGE burger patty, guacamole, salsa verde (but it really wasn&#39;t even there), on top of an english muffin, which was different. The meat was good quality and I ordered it medium rare but it wasn&#39;t cooked to that standard and the meat was, to be honest, just flat out plain and unflavored. Not to mentioned the guacamole was also tasteless so altogether, the burger was just a pretty tasteless combination of good quality meat. In addition, there was no real juiciness from the patty that was expected. Honestly, didn&#39;t think it was worth the hype :/ Finally went there after spending many years hearing from friends and colleagues about how awesome the food is at The Bird. It&#39;s definitely over the top for meat lovers, nothing extraordinary actually but it&#39;s not so common to find such a tasty meat in Berlin. The service is also fine and seems largely inspired from the Hard Rock café processes. Now there&#39;s a little problem with seating and the capacity of this place. I don&#39;t mind having strangers seating really REALLY (touching) close from me in this town but that&#39;s an issue when I&#39;m charged 11,50€ for a burger and fries. The forks and knives are optional and while I agree that it&#39;s not useful to eat a burger, it comes handy to enjoy those delicious fries and sauces. Some sanitised hand towels would be nice as well, the provided paper tissue is a disgrace. Burgermeister does this right, we&#39;re not in the Massachusetts after all.I disliked the pressure from the nice and lovely waiters to order drink and food ( 1 minute after seating), or trying twice to clear up our spot while we were not done yet with our food.All in all this place would be a 5 stars rating if prices were 25 percent cheaper but we&#39;ve got charged 40Euros for two which is nothing in many cities but way too much in Berlin. Give it a shot on a not so crowded day which is never. Im in love with the bird! The Meat and the fries! Think it&#39;s the Best burger in BERLIN so fare :) the pictures speak for themselves. I&#39;ve heard a lot of praise for The Bird since I moved to Berlin but when I finally went there myself tonight I was underwhelmed. The atmosphere is good and it is perfect for large groups.  The music was great!  You definitely leave smelling like grease but that&#39;s okay by me.  Service was attentive and friendly. I had the hot wings as a starter and they were quite tasty.  Probably the best wings I have had in Berlin thus far.  They were coated in sauce but weren&#39;t soggy.  I really liked the sauce; it tasted kind of like bbq sauce and had a nice level of heat, although I think the hot could be a little hotter.  My husband had the napalm wings and he was sweating - and loving it. As far as the burgers go, I just wasn&#39;t impressed.  The menu offerings weren&#39;t creative at all; just your standard options like cheese, bacon, guac, bleu cheese, etc.  I&#39;m used to burger joints in Berlin having really exciting toppings like peanut butter, pineapple, Gorgonzola, curry sauce - fun stuff!  Maybe The Bird is trying to be &#34;American&#34; but even in the States we love a creative burger!  It seemed that the high cost of the burgers (€10+) must come from the absurdly large patty, not the toppings.  I had The Big Rock and was pretty disappointed with the lackluster execution.  I guess I&#39;m just not a fan of huge burger patties.  They&#39;re hard to eat and hard to cook properly, which is probably why my medium burger was well done on the outside and the center was raw.  The gigantic patties seem like a gimmick to me.  I would prefer a wider, thinner patty that can be cooked evenly.  I thought the English muffin bun was nice, although the bottom half did become a soggy mess.  The cheese on my burger was cut way too thick so it didn&#39;t even melt!  No one likes cold hard cheese on their burger. :(  It had fresh &#34;jalapeños&#34; but I&#39;m not sure they were real because they were tiny, paper thin &amp; hardly spicy.  Overall my burger didn&#39;t have much taste and was a big let down.  I wanted so badly to jump on The Bird bandwagon and love their over priced burger as much as everyone else!  But I can&#39;t.  There are so many other burger restaurants that are cheaper, have more interesting menus, and where I&#39;ve never been disappointed with the quality.  If I ever go back I will probably stick to eating wings, they were the highlight of my meal. The Bird is the word!I went to Berlin for New Years, 2010. While looking for a place to eat, the taxi driver suggested, The Bird. It was a little drive from our hostel, but absolutely worth it. The atmosphere was amazing, the service was quick and the best part by far was the food! The guys ordered steaks which were manly and soooo delicious!!! I ordered the most juiciest burger I have ever had, it was massive!! Everything was soooo good!!I would come back here at anytime and would definitely suggest this place to anyone!Thank you taxi driver! The bird is definitely the word! I am a fan of this place, despite their burgers not being the best in Berlin. The atmosphere here is very relaxed and &#39;berlin esqe&#39;, everyone drinking, eating and chatting away without a care in the world. Our server here was pretty awesome. She was from London originally so she spoke english, and also gave us free Jager shots after our meal! Our food came out in a timely manner, all our orders were right and their fries were homemade!!! So on to the burger, they cook them to order, serve them on an english muffin (weird, but good idea I thought) which forces you to focus on the meat quality not the bread. Also does not fill you up on bread, instead on the meat and fries.  I ordered my burger medium and it came out a bit too rare for me (not sure if this hurt the chances of this burger being number one, but I think not).   Their meat is freshly grinded they said, and seems to taste different then other burger meats, but at a medium rare ish temperature I did not find it to be awesome, just good. Many people said this was the &#39;locals best burger place in berlin,&#39; and although I will agree we were the only &#39;non locals&#39; I would not go here for the burgers again, but the beer. They have a great selection of beer from other places which I think livens up their menu of meats only.So to sum it up, atmosphere is an A +, Burgers are a B-, Fries are an A, Service is an A+, Which overall makes this place a good hangout but not a favorite for me burgerwise. The burger was really well cooked, nice and juicy. Overall I enjoyed it, it just didn&#39;t live up to the hype that had been built. Worst customer service I have gotten in Berlin. Came with a friend before they opened to see if we needed a reservation. The girl working seemed so nice, spoke great english, smiled, and said that because we were only two people, we did not need to make a reservation - they would be able to seat us. My friend and I waited for the place to open (it did not open until 6!) There was quite the line up, and the girl at the door turned her nose up at us when we told her we had not reserved. I found the girl I had spoken to earlier, and she was suddenly incredibly rude also. She told me that &#39;she didn&#39; t realise it would be so busy so we would just have to come back&#39;. I know these types of places, we have them in our town too. Once it is featured somewhere and becomes popular, the quality and service declines. They already have enough business, so why bother to put in any extra effort? I was so disappointed in the way I was spoken to and treated. They may have a great burger, but I will never find out for myself - I could never hand my money over to a place with such rude staff. Really good burgers and beers!! Generous and good quality.Unfortunately we have waited for more than one hour to be served... Too bad. The service is good. This is a very attractive restaurant in a convenient location with a really friendly staff. The portions are huge! So i ordered the turkey club which was really delicious with a great turkey, crisp bacon and nice tomato. We also got &#34;da birdhouse&#34; burger which was huge! Two juicy patties with american cheese and a mountain of fries. The english muffin it is served on is a surprise but worked really well and stood up to the enormous burger and toppings. The fries were a mix of skinny steak fries and wedges which meant that some were soggy and some were over cooked.As a bonus the pickles were dill and not sweet! Nein. As someone else mentioned, public seating and the general discomfort associated with it is fine....... as long as one is not being charged €11 for a burger. I happened to be seated next to two very loud and energetic folks who kept rocking the bench. Felt it would have been kind of antisocial to ask them to relax a bit, so I suffered in silence (they were seemingly nice folks otherwise.) So. A regular &#34;Ghetto&#34; burger is €9,50. The next step up? A cheeseburger, for €11. €1,50 for a slice of cheese? Ok. The other options ranged from €11-15 or so. Kind of a lot for a burger and fries in Berlin. As for the fries-- kind of lame. My portion seemed limp and not fresh. Looked like they had been sitting around for a while.I waited an hour for my burger, which arrived at the same time as my ebullient neighbors&#39; burgers. They had gotten there about 20 minutes later than I. There was no attempt at apologizing or explaining. But Ok. I&#39;ve gotten my burger, I&#39;m hungry, I&#39;m not going to complain. The bun: a pathetic, tiny English muffin. Seems like a cop out. I&#39;m American but I don&#39;t know anyone who eats those on a regular basis.The servers&#39; fake smiles were authentic American, they got that down for sure.All in all, I&#39;d understand coming here if you&#39;re German and want a &#34;cultural&#34; experience (in this case staff who don&#39;t speak your language) and an average burger. Nothing about this experience blew my mind except how giant the burger was. TL;DR: if you happen upon The Bird, you&#39;re craving a burger and you&#39;ve got ~€13 to spare, go right ahead. If you want The Best Burger in Berlin... look elsewhere (and let me know when you find it.) We reserved a table for 7pm, but it was in they schedule at 8pm, but we got a table and made our choice quite quick. For me it was a Dr.Zian Burger with blue cheese and extra guacamole from the grill. Why I write from the grill? Cause there are 2 different kinds of burgers there both with 250+ grams of premium German beef how it&#39;s written on the menu. I haven&#39;t weight it but the burger was quite huge. There are 3 burgers from the griddle which means 2 pieces of meat (together 250+). The rest is from the grill with one huge piece of meat. I ordered the burger medium rare. It took some time to get the burger but it was quite busy and it was worth to wait.. The meat was juicy and very good. While we were invited to a birthday after this I haven&#39;t tried the cheesecake or something.. But after that burger served with fried I wouldn&#39;t be able to eat it anyway. When we asked for the bill it took some time.. Exactly till we asked again while we have been forgotten. But was not a big deal. I definitely want to go back and try something different as well. The Bird is definitely worth going for everyone who is looking for good burgers in Berlin, particularly American standards - perfect or not.....probably as good as it gets in Deutschland. Nice atmosphere, super friendly service. music little too loud to my taste. it seems impossible to get in there without a reservation. we were lucky and got a spot at the bar. which was actually great! nice chatting with the bar tenders. small but great US beer selection. There is Brooklyn Lager :-) Overpriced Hipstar Burger joint with bad service. Don&#39;t go there if you wanna talk to the people you go to dinner with.Nevertheless I have to say the Meat quality is very good but there are nicer places in Berlin to enjoy a good piece of Meat When we arrived at 10:30pm, the place was packed to the gills. We put our name on the waiting list (didn&#39;t realize we could have gotten a reservation) and had a drink next door at the Mexican restaurant (which was very good). They called us 25 minutes later (much shorter wait than we thought) and we went back and were served cold beer (by a very nice waitress) within minutes. We all ordered burgers and they arrived only 15 minutes later.I mean, the burgers are good and the fries are hand cut, but there is nothing so special about the food. It&#39;s good, it&#39;s not memorable. I would not go back to The Bird, but I don&#39;t regret going there in the first place. Solid 4 stars.Very popular place!We sure missed delicious american, fatty burgers, so we dropped by.Generous portion! Comes with delicious seasoned fries.Ordered:1) Birdhouse burger: 4/5 OMG....this was prob the largest burger I have ever seen. It had 3 patties! 2) Dumb texan burger: 4/5 Delish. I ordered this one b/c it has an egg in it :DBe warned: Consuming your burgers will create a huge mess! It&#39;s actually very difficult to bite your burger w/o it falling apart!What made this place unique? The burgers are served on english muffins. Delish! I went there last year for lunch with two friends. The place is nice, friendly, good atmosphere, etc. Each of us ordered a burger, and we tried our friends&#39; burgers. All were ok, but nothing to die for. These burgers are *extremely* greasy and heavy. Given this, I&#39;m not too sure to understand the amazing rating/long line/etc. We absolutely loved this place. SUCH a great vibe, awesome music, great service and um....DELICIOUS burgers. They serve it on an English muffin (toastie), which I had never had before, but proved to be genius because is soaks up all the juiciness of the burger without getting soggy. In fact, when we make burgers at home (Munich), we use English muffins now since burger buns are hard to come by and are usually not that great. Any time I am in Berlin, I will definitely come here. Tasty but expensive. Burger with bacon and blue cheese sauce (with a big slice of tomato and fries, burned) for 13€, tips not included as clearly printed on the bill! Beef patty was the best part but suggest that you order well done if you don&#39;t want to get a quite uncooked medium rare. All staff insisted on speaking English even tho I tried in German. Yes and no, might come back again in a year. I came here with high expectations - never a good idea. As an American who enjoys good food and enjoys cooking at home I should know a really good burger when I taste one. The bird made it to the top of my list of places to try because they were named best burger in this year&#39;s zitty Essen guide and that in the midst of the major burger hype that&#39;s been raging through berlin for at least a year. Therefore the high expectations...I loved the irregularity of their burger - not a perfectly shaped patty but a lopsided, fat, difficult-to-hold burger. You could tell they made them by hand. I also liked that they or someone grinds the beef coarser than your average burger. It reminded me of a coarse tartar. The bun was small and looked homemade, even like an English muffin, which was a pleasant surprise given that most restaurant burgers come on oversized, dry, bland buns. I ordered the cheddar burger as American cheese makes me want to... My critique started when I tasted the meat. Somehow, it was lacking in flavor - maybe not enough salt, not enough fat or not enough TLC somewhere along the line (cow to plate). Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoyed the burger and would go back but wasn&#39;t as blown away as I hoped to be. To give them a little more credit, you can tell they pride themselves on cooking the burgers to your desired doneness and mine was perfectly medium rare. The fries were good but way more than one person should eat in a day - they have adopted the bad habit of oversized portions from home of the burger. There was nothing special about the chicken wings. We got the mild version which you should never do with wings - it&#39;s either hot or not at all. Relaxed atmosphere, very friendly staff but a warning: your clothes will stink after leaving at least where they seated us, next to the kitchen - a bad idea. Also, they tout their craft beer selection on their blackboard but only have it in bottles - nice try but no dice. One more gripe: no credit cards. I&#39;m  familiar with the small business standard in Germany, but in the digital age where credit cards are out and paying with your phone is in, Berlin needs to get with the program. There&#39;s so much I could say about The Bird, but I&#39;ll keep it short:1) If you think you can handle the napalm wings, think again. They allow you to get a side of napalm sauce instead, so do that if you&#39;re feeling adventurous.2) You can &#34;pimp&#34; the fries that come with your burger by adding chili to them but it&#39;s a ton of food, so share the love.3) If you order a burger medium, it will come medium well.4) Our waitress gave us free shots because she was impressed that we could finish everything we ordered. But then again, we&#39;re used to American portions.5) If you like jalapenos, then I highly recommend the Big Rock. So, apparently the Bird is the place to be for American Transplants in Berlin.  Specifically, they claim to serve the best burger this side of the Atlantic.  Shame I didn&#39;t have our resident London Yelping Burger Kings Andrew and Grant with me to pass judgement!  I&#39;ll try my best to come to my own conclusions then.We started with some bloody marys and wings- wings were flipping delicious, marching that beautiful crispy, yet swelling with sauce line.  Bloody Marys... well I always feel sad that they are not Caesars.  That&#39;s all I could say about Bloody Marys.  Theirs were good.  They were just not Caesars!Now the main act of burger.  My sister and I shared the Birdhouse which was delicious.  A bit fally-a-party (which TBH since they make such a frakking fuss about us using cutlery and cussing us on the menu should be less difficult to eat) but a perfect goo of mince meat and american cheese with awesome bacon and good home fries (a mix of skinny and fat chips).  Only caveat I have is that the salad bits could be better and more flavourful.  Just Sayin&#39;.Overall a good experience.  Saw some good action with a family (who were all so mardy, but then perked up with their mega soakers) getting banned from the restaurant and loads of hipsters by the truckload.I&#39;d advise you to share.  Those burgers are Massive!  As in we had 2 burgers between 4 and we didn&#39;t finish.  Our friends had one each and barely made a dent in their plates. Sloppy, greasy over the top meatballish beef patties served on an english muffin. (A traditional hamburger bun would never have held up) Hand cut french fries good flavor although mostly soft and limp and saturated in oil. Atmosphere young fun and hip : 30ish and younger will feel right at home here and probably not have thoughts of restaurant healthcodes crossing their minds as they dive in. Great burger but what on earth is up with the &#34;buns&#34;?!?!  Why are they on English muffins?!?!? Nobody in their right mind should put delicious burgers on a crappy English muffin...I am baffled right now by this insanity. When you read blog posts or online reviews about The Bird, you can easily get confused as there is a 60/40 mixture between &#34;best burger in town&#34; and &#34;I fucking hate this place&#34;. Let`s find out to which group we belong.The Ghetto Deluxe consists of 250+ grams (!) of premium German beef, American cheese, fried onions and an English breakfast muffin. On top of that you have some red onion, lettuce, tomato and pickle on the side, which you can add to your burger if you feel like. The huge patty is undoubtedly one of the best in Berlin, the taste is delicious and it`s prepared in a perfect way: very crispy on the outside and almost raw in the middle, a dream for every meat lover. Or as the restaurant describes it in their menu, &#34;in other dumps it would be a steak, here it goes through our grinder every couple of hours to become the best burger in Berlin&#34;. The cheese is melted really nicely and the onions are the best and most intense I ever had on a burger. In fact the entire composition is so juicy and flavourful, that you don`t need any sauce at all and just want to enjoy it as it is. After having finished our chorus of praise, we still need to talk about the bun. Even though I know The Bird`s opinion on the topic and recently read on the fanpage, that they &#34;are too busy making quality burgers to worry about making bread&#34;, I would still love to get this served in a proper bun.Regardless of that, we fucking love this burger: 5(+)/5- more burger reviews on Facebook: BerlinBuns - One of the best burgers in Berlin, really loved this place, I will come back The Bird was an easy 15 minute walk away from where we stayed in Berlin. You won&#39;t want to walk for 15 minutes after eating here - but you probably need to. Expect big, belly-stretching burgers and plenty of beer if you go here. We rolled up shortly after 8 on a Saturday night. We seem to have a bad habit of doing this at busy restaurants, but perhaps due to our lucky streak and demonstrable greediness we always get seated relatively quickly. At The Bird we got a round in, sat outside for about 10 minutes and then got seats at the bar. This was a surprisingly good vantage point for inspecting the decor and chatting with the bar staff. I kept thinking that I would have loved this place in my angsty teen years - all skater style and fuck you attitude with heavy music and amusingly passive aggressive notes in the menu.And the food. We got mild chicken wings which were as tasty as you would want chicken wings to be, and came with a delicious chunky blue cheese dip. I had Da Birdhouse and Rich had the BBQ burger. Honestly, mine was a bit of a mess and started actually falling to pieces the minute I got my mitts round it. It was still a really good plate of food though, with masses of chips and a fairly fresh afterthought of a salad garnish. Rich, when quizzed, said his was &#39;pretty damn tasty&#39;. Service was good in a chatty, friendly, casual way. I think it may have been a little overpriced after eating much cheaper meals in Berlin, but it didn&#39;t break the bank. If I&#39;m back in Berlin at any point I&#39;d definitely consider a visit. Delish, huge portions, ok price, but always packed!!! I had to make a reservation more than a week out because this place was booked solid. That&#39;s a little insane for a burger restaurant. It has gotten to a point where me and my bf have started to avoid this place. However, the food makes it definitely worth at least one visit. Lovely and friendly staff. Specially good that they speak English fluently. I have only tried one of their burgers which I unfortunately do not remember which one (only once been there, July 2014) and I still remember the real MEAT taste of its Patty. Recommend to meat-lovers. Enormous perfectly cooked burger served in English muffin... yes please!My only complaint: like almost every other burger place in berlin they do not serve milkshakes. Madness. Good: the vibe, the beers, the location, the portions, the friesBad: arrogant, understaffed, overpriced, slowBottom line: If you have time to take a 2 hour nap afterwards, go get a burger here. Really good burger with real good meat for a good price. I highly recommend it for people who are really hungry. We decided to try these mythical american burgers in our weekend trip to Berlin even if it meant a 18 € cab ride from the west side of town over to the east side where The Bird is located. The tought of a juicy and greasy burger was even more appealing since we had been out drinking the wonderful german beer the night before.....ha ha. Anyway.......We arrived at 1 pm on a saturday wich is 1 hour after opening. The complete inner sitting area was full and all tables on the outside accept one that we quickly sat down at.  The peachy waitress came and took our order wich was 6 beers (2 each) and a burger and fries each. My thought was that we could have one beer while waiting on the food and another one when the burgers arrived since ive read that the burgers could be a grueling 45 min away if you are unlucky.  Not this day though! After a sip and a half on the cold beer my burger named &#34;Da Birdhouse&#34; with double pattys grilled medium (it almost cam out mooing at me) with bacon, cheddar cheese, ketchup, lettuce, tomato and mustard. Large mayo bottle on the tables for those who want that on the burger.  Burger tasted awesome! I must say that this is one of the top 3 or so burgers i have had outside the U.S and ive had a lot! The patty where real juicy and packed with flavor and came together like a masterpiece with the salty bacon and creamy cheddar. Yummy in my tummy.....! The homemade english muffin burger bread was a liiiiitle on the small side but i had no problem eating it with my hands anyway. I give them an A for effort since most burgerplaces has the prefabricated supermarket buns we all have learned to hate. Frice felt tripplefried and they where as crispy as they come. Delicious with mayo! Price you may ask! The burger with fries was 11,50 € and a for 15 € even you get a large cold one with your meal (you know you want it!).  Great burgers, value, ambiance and service. Love burgers and beers?? Go go go and thank me later! Ps: Only cash accepted! Not sure why this place has so many great reviews. As you can see on the pictures, the actual burger is quite small, but they fill you up with awful fries. Our fries were way too greasy and most of them were burnt. The burger is served medium, mine was more well done. They state you should try eat it with your hands, well we tried, but after 5 bites everything falls apart as they don&#39;t use proper buns. The prices are way to high for Berlin, around 13 EUR for a burger and 5 EUR for a cider. I paid less in London or New York for better burgers. Last but not least don&#39;t expect good service. We were rushed out as the place is always packed and they don&#39;t give you the table for long. I will not return there, for a good burger I rather go to Tartane or Marienburger, both are way better. This place is so overrated. House burger is tiny and costs 11.50. It&#39;s a normal burger with some cheese. Bacon and bread. No special ingredients. No special taste. Not sure what the fuzz on this place is about **Best burgers and handmade fries in Berlin**American burger restaurant with big and greasy burgers and sides. High focus on quality meat which is cooked to perfection according to your prefence! Friendly service and english speaking waiters. Enjoy angry hour at the wooden bar with a great selection of beverages. (PS: you will never run put of mayo!!! :) Doggybag is available for leftovers. I&#39;ll be back! The atmosphere was laid back fun. The staff speaks English and are very friendly.  It was my husbands birthday wish to go so we drove all the way from Bavaria area, made it with 5mins til the kitchen closed and Ben, our waiter put us at ease and made us feel welcome and took our food order and gave us recommendations.  It was a stellar experience! We are definitely coming back again and again. I just wish we didn&#39;t live 5hrs away. I love their Breakfast Burger. And their meat tasted like a burger made in the USA! No weird after taste like Argentinian beef. Very very busy and popular place, so DEFINITELY make a reservation... and even then you&#39;ll be stood around waiting for a bit!I ordered a burger which was very tasty, but a bit too thick in my opinion. The fries were okay but I couldn&#39;t eat a lot of them. Partner ordered a NY Strip in &#34;500g&#34; as recommended, but a server told us they had a 650g one in the kitchen which wouldn&#39;t need cutting if we wanted it, but for the 600g price... turned out this was a 22oz steak, and again, very very thick. It was tasty, and cooked as desired, but a bit too thick to eat it properly in an enjoyable way. The staff were very friendly but a little inattentive unless you went out of your way to get their attention, as they were very busy, (ie, after waiting to get someone&#39;s eye so we could get a menu after finally being seated, we gave up and went and found one ourselves after about 10 minutes). The venue itself is small but cosy and has a very good atmosphere. The menus are presented in a detailed and fun way, including the lines &#34;at least try eating the burger with your damn hands!&#34; and &#34;and for God&#39;s sake, don&#39;t order your meat well done!&#34;, all a bit tongue in cheek, but fun. It&#39;s quite a walk from the nearest U-Bahn or S-Bahn though, so take a map!Only thing is, it was pretty expensive! The steak (although a big bugger) was 48 Euro! Ouch!It was a nice place to visit once, but we probably wouldn&#39;t go out of our way to go again (not that we&#39;d be adverse to a return).
