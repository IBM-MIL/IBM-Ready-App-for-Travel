	 *     type                 String   Sets the object's type.
	 *     start_time           Long     The start time for this event. Before being returned to the client this will represent the 
	 *                                   number of milliseconds from the Epoch.  At class creation time will actually be an offset

	 *                                   to represent the full time from the Epoch. So setting this value to 86400000l (24 hours in
	 *                                   milliseconds) will end up showing up as midnight tomorrow on the client that gets this event.
	 *     end_time             Long     The end time for this event.  Like the start_time described above this is actually an offset
	 *                                   representing a time in the future.
	 *     details              String   Some detailed information about this step.
	 *     departureArea        String   The location from which this step starts.
	 *     arrivalArea          String   The location where this step ends.
	 *     transitLine          String   For Rail and Bus type steps only, the line which you need to catch.
	 *     stops                Double   For Rail and Bus type steps only,  the number of stops on this step.
	 *     walkTime             String   The amount of time it takes to walk to the arrivalArea.
	 *     title                String   For Car type steps only, the name of the car service to use.
	 *     partnerName			String	 For Partner type steps only, the name of the partner service.
	 *     partnerPickupTime	String	 For Partner type steps only, the time until the user can be picked up.
	 *     fareNotice			String	 For Partner type steps only, an info string about how fares may vary.
	 *     seatsRemaining		String	 For Partner type steps only, the number of seats that are still available.
	 *     
	 * @param data The Map that should contain the keys described above to properly construct this object.
