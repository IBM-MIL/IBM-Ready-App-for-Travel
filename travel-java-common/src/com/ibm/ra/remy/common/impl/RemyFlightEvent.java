	 * Default constructor which creates a Flight object from a map of data. The Map needs to contain the following
	 * keys in order to fully create the object.
	 * 
	 *     Key                  Type     Value
	 *     
	 * Values needed by the CloudantObject parent class.
	 *     
	 *     _id                  String   Sets the objects unique ID
	 *     type                 String   Sets the objects type
	 *     _rev                 String   Sets the revision of the object. This corresponds to the revision in Cloudant.
	 *     
	 * Values needed by the parent RemyEventImpl class.
	 *     
	 *     subtype              String   The subtype of this event.  Usually one of the following: flight, restaurant, transit
	 *     start_time           Long     The start time for this event. Before being returned to the client this will represent the 
	 *                                   number of milliseconds from the Epoch.  At class creation time will actually be an offset
	 *                                   representing some time in the future.  This value will be added to midnight of todays date
	 *                                   to represent the full time from the Epoch. So setting this value to 86400000l (24 hours in
	 *                                   milliseconds) will end up showing up as midnight tomorrow on the client that gets this event.
	 *     end_time             Long     The end time for this event.  Like the start_time described above this is actually an offset
	 *                                   representing a time in the future.
	 *                   
	 * Keys required for this class
	 * 
	 *     boardingTime         Long     The boarding time for this flight.
	 *     departureTime        Long     The departure time for this flight.
	 *     arrivalTime          Long     The arrival time for this flight.
	 *     departureAirportCode String   The airport code for the departure flight.
	 *     arrivalLocation      CloudantLocation The location of where the flight is heading too.
	 *     departureLocation    CloudantLocation The location of the place the flight is leaving.
	 *     arrivalAirportCode   String   The airport code of the arrival airport.
	 *     gate                 String   The gate for the departing flight.
	 *     terminal             String   The terminal for the departing flight.
	 *     
	 * @param data The Map that should contain the keys described above to properly construct this object.
	 * @param itineraryId The id of the itinerary that owns this lodging event.
