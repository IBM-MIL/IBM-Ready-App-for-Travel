	 * Constructor that will generate a RemyRestaurantEvent object with the given data.  To fully create the object, the Map
	 * provided should contain the following keys:
	 * 
	 *     Key                  Type     Value
	 *     
	 * Values needed by the CloudantObject parent class.
	 *     
	 *     _id                  String   Sets the objects unique ID
	 *     type                 String   Sets the objects type
	 *     _rev                 String   Sets the revision of the object. This corresponds to the revision in Cloudant.
	 *     
	 * Values needed by the parent RemyEventImpl class.
	 *     
	 *     subtype              String   The subtype of this event.  Usually one of the following: flight, restaurant, transit
	 *     start_time           Long     The start time for this event. Before being returned to the client this will represent the 
	 *                                   number of milliseconds from the Epoch.  At class creation time will actually be an offset
	 *                                   representing some time in the future.  This value will be added to midnight of todays date
	 *                                   to represent the full time from the Epoch. So setting this value to 86400000l (24 hours in
	 *                                   milliseconds) will end up showing up as midnight tomorrow on the client that gets this event.
	 *     end_time             Long     The end time for this event.  Like the start_time described above this is actually an offset
	 *                                   representing a time in the future.
	 *                   
	 * Keys required for this class
	 * 
	 *     meetingName			String   The name of this restaurant to be displayed on the itinerary.
	 *     name                 String   The name of this restaurant to be displayed in other parts of the app.
	 *     price_level          Double   The price range of the food served at this restaurant.
	 *     rating               Double   The average rating for this restaurant. 
	 *     cuisine              String   The type of cuisine served at this restaurant.
	 *     distance             String   The distance to this restaurant from the previous meeting.
	 *     location             String   The street address of this restaurant.

	 *     reviewer             String   The name of the reviewer.
	 *     reviewTime           String   The time the review was created.
	 *     isPreferred			boolean	 Whether or not this is a preferred option (for iOS display).
	 *     vicinity             String   The street address for this event.
	 *     isOutdoor            Boolean  States whether this event venue is outdoors or not.
	 *     time                 Long     The start time of this meeting.  Stored in milliseconds. This should be a time in the future
	 *                                   stored as an offset from midnight today.
	 *     geometry             GooglePlacesLocation This is a Map that should be used to create a {@link com.ibm.ra.remy.common.impl.GooglePlacesLocation GooglePlacesLocation}
	 *                                               object.  See it for more information about what's needed.
	 *     imageUrl             String   A URL that depicts an image of the event location.
