	 * Values needed by the parent RemyEventImpl class.

	 *     subtype              String   The subtype of this event.  Usually one of the following: flight, restaurant, transit
	 *     start_time           Long     The start time for this event. Before being returned to the client this will represent the 
	 *                                   number of milliseconds from the Epoch.  At class creation time will actually be an offset

	 *                                   to represent the full time from the Epoch. So setting this value to 86400000l (24 hours in
	 *                                   milliseconds) will end up showing up as midnight tomorrow on the client that gets this event.
	 *     end_time             Long     The end time for this event.  Like the start_time described above this is actually an offset
	 *                                   representing a time in the future.

	 * Keys required for this class
	 * 
	 *     rec_type				String	 The type of RemyEvent being recommended.
	 *     message				String	 The text to be displayed on the itinerary along with this recommendation event.
	 *     alert				boolean	 Whether this is an emergency recommendation or not (for weather).
	 *     fromLocation			String	 For transit events, this indicates where the transit begins.
	 *     toLocation			String	 For transit events, this indicates where the transit ends.
	 *     lodgingLocation		String	 For lodging events, this indicates where the hotels are located generally.
